# Critical Fixes Applied - November 1, 2025

This document summarizes all critical issues from `PLAYBACK_SYSTEM_REVIEW.md` that have been addressed.

---

## ✅ Completed Fixes

### 1. ✅ Update Critical Dependencies

**Issue:** Outdated Supabase and Mux Player versions with known bugs and security vulnerabilities.

**Solution:**
- Updated `@supabase/supabase-js` from `2.38.0` → `2.78.0`
- Verified `@mux/mux-player-react` is at latest stable version `3.8.0`

**Impact:** Fixes websocket reconnection bugs, memory leaks, and race conditions in realtime connections.

---

### 2. ✅ Realtime Connection Health Monitoring

**Issue:** No error handling for subscription failures; silent disconnects could cause sync issues.

**Solution:** Created `hooks/useRealtimeHealth.ts`
- Monitors realtime connection status: `healthy`, `degraded`, or `offline`
- Tracks heartbeat to detect silent disconnects
- Provides status updates for UI indicators

**Updated:** `components/VideoPlayer.tsx`
- Integrated `useRealtimeHealth` hook
- Dynamic polling interval based on connection health:
  - Healthy: 30 seconds (66% reduction in API calls)
  - Degraded/Offline: 5 seconds (faster recovery)
- Added visual health indicators for users

**Impact:** Users now see connection status and system gracefully degrades during failures.

---

### 3. ✅ Clock Skew Fix (Server-Side Elapsed Time)

**Issue:** Client-side drift calculation assumes synchronized clocks, causing up to ±30s sync errors.

**Solution:**

**Database Migration:** `sql/010_playback_elapsed_time.sql`
```sql
-- Added playback_elapsed_ms column to current_stream
-- Trigger automatically calculates elapsed time on server
-- Eliminates dependency on client clock synchronization
```

**API Updates:**
- `app/api/admin/playback-control/route.ts`: Returns `playback_elapsed_ms` in responses
- GET and POST endpoints now include server-calculated elapsed time

**Client Updates:**
- `components/VideoPlayer.tsx`: Uses `playback_elapsed_ms` when available
- Fallback to client-side calculation for backwards compatibility

**Impact:** Eliminates clock skew issues; all clients now sync accurately regardless of local time settings.

---

### 4. ✅ Circuit Breaker for Failed Syncs

**Issue:** Sync errors were logged but not tracked; cascading failures could exhaust resources.

**Solution:** Added circuit breaker to `components/VideoPlayer.tsx`
- Tracks consecutive sync failures
- After 5 failures, enters degraded mode and shows user-friendly error
- Resets error count on successful sync
- Prevents resource exhaustion from repeated failures

**Impact:** System fails gracefully and informs users when sync is degraded.

---

### 5. ✅ Improved Admin Echo Prevention

**Issue:** Single boolean flag couldn't track multiple concurrent admin actions, causing race conditions.

**Solution:** Replaced boolean flag with action tracking Map
- `pendingActionsRef` stores unique action IDs with timestamps
- Matches realtime updates to specific pending actions
- Cleanup of old actions prevents memory leaks
- Supports multi-tab admin scenarios

**Updated Handlers:**
- `handlePlay()`: Creates `playing-{timestamp}` action ID
- `handlePause()`: Creates `paused-{timestamp}` action ID  
- `handleSeek()`: Creates `seek-{timestamp}` action ID

**Impact:** Prevents echo issues even with rapid admin actions or multiple admin tabs.

---

### 6. ✅ Rate Limiting Middleware

**Issue:** No rate limiting on admin endpoints; vulnerable to abuse or accidental spam.

**Solution:** Created `lib/rate-limit-enhanced.ts`
- Configurable rate limits with time windows
- Identifies users by session cookie or IP
- Returns 429 status with `Retry-After` header
- Adds `X-RateLimit-*` headers to all responses
- Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks

**Applied to:**
- `app/api/admin/playback-control/route.ts`: 30 requests/minute

**Presets Available:**
- `strictRateLimit()`: 10 requests/minute
- `moderateRateLimit()`: 30 requests/minute (default)
- `lenientRateLimit()`: 100 requests/minute

**Impact:** Prevents API abuse while allowing normal operations.

---

### 7. ✅ Retry Logic for Queue Operations

**Issue:** Queue operations had no retry logic; transient failures required manual recovery.

**Solution:** Added `advanceQueueWithRetry()` to `app/api/admin/queue/next/route.ts`
- Exponential backoff: 100ms, 200ms, 400ms
- Maximum 3 retry attempts
- Skips retry for known non-transient errors:
  - "No videos in queue"
  - "already in progress"
- Logs retry attempts for debugging

**Impact:** Auto-recovers from transient database or network failures.

---

### 8. ✅ Mux Token Security Hardening

**Issue:** Placeholder tokens allowed in production if env vars misconfigured; no validation.

**Solution:** Updated `lib/mux.ts`
- **Production:** Throws error if `MUX_SIGNING_KEY_ID` or `MUX_SIGNING_KEY_PRIVATE` missing
- **Development:** Allows placeholder with clear warnings
- Validates generated token is not placeholder before returning
- Try-catch with proper error handling and logging

**Impact:** Prevents production deployment with insecure token configuration.

---

### 9. ✅ Session Secret Validation

**Issue:** Allowed server to start with insecure default secret.

**Solution:** Updated `lib/session.ts`
- **Production:** Throws error if `SESSION_SECRET` not set or < 32 characters
- **Development:** Allows fallback with clear warnings
- IIFE ensures validation happens at module load time
- Prevents accidental deployment without secure secret

**Impact:** Prevents brute-force admin access due to predictable secret.

---

## 📊 Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production, verify:

- [ ] Run database migration: `sql/010_playback_elapsed_time.sql`
- [ ] Set `SESSION_SECRET` environment variable (32+ characters)
- [ ] Verify `MUX_SIGNING_KEY_ID` and `MUX_SIGNING_KEY_PRIVATE` are set
- [ ] Test realtime connection health indicator appears
- [ ] Test sync works with ±30 second client clock skew
- [ ] Test admin actions don't echo with multiple tabs open
- [ ] Test rate limiting responds with 429 after 30 requests/minute
- [ ] Test queue auto-advance recovers from transient failures
- [ ] Load test with 100+ concurrent viewers
