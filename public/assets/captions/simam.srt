1
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,130
Excuse me, miss.
There seems to be a mistake.

2
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,870
I believe l ordered
the large cappuccino.

3
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,170
Hello!

4
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,300
Look at the size of this.

5
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,350
My sides.

6
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,920
So, Tony, what's the deal
with your clothes?

7
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,400
What do you mean?

8
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,990
You look like Huggy Bear
from Starsky and Hutch.

9
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,000
What? l look hip.

10
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,170
No, no. You look like an undercover cop
trying to Iook hip.

11
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,180
l am an undercover cop
trying to look hip.

12
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,340
Yes, but can you do me a favor?

13
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,280
When you come to my parents' house,
do not dress like a 1970's pimp.

14
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,410
My parents are a little eccentric.

15
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:14,550
My next poem is caIled, ''An Open
Apology to the AIiens Who Abducted Me...

16
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,350
and Whom I Inflicted
Great Destruction Upon...

17
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,360
While Having a Panic Attack
Aboard the Mother Ship.''

18
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,690
Autobiographical.

19
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,800
What wilI you do tonight?

20
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,860
l think I'm gonna do a poem
about Sherry.

21
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,340
- Oh.
- Yeah.

22
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,380
- The '"Woman, Woe-Man, Whoa, Man'' poem.
- Yeah.

23
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,980
So teLl me again,
why did you break up with Sherry?

24
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,520
I told you aIready.
She's a thief.

25
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,460
- You don't beIieve that.
- She's a kIepto, all right?

26
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,550
To this day, I still don't know
where my cat is.

27
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,460
Charlie, every time
you meet a nice girl...

28
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,030
you come up with some paranoid reason
to break up with her.

29
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,540
That's not true. l broke up
with those girIs for very good reasons.

30
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,400
- Really?
- Yes.

31
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,170
- What about Jill?
- She was in the Mafia.

32
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,850
- She was in the Mafia?
- Yes. The Cosa Nostra.

33
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,850
While we went out, she didn't teIl me
what she did for a living.

34
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,850
She was unempIoyed.

35
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,450
That's the perfect cover, isn't it?

36
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,120
AIl right. What about Pam?

37
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,070
She smelIed like soup.

38
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,340
- What does that mean?
- She smelled like beef vegetable soup.

39
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,530
- You're paranoid.
- You weren't there.

40
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,410
lt's alI in your head.
It is!

41
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,780
All right, L'm up.
Wish me luck.

42
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:00,660
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it
for our own Mr. Charlie Mackenzie.

43
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,340
Woman

44
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,010
Woe-man

45
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,280
Whoa, man

46
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,790
She was a thief
You gotta believe

47
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,520
She stole my heart and my cat

48
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,260
Betty, Judy

49
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,990
Josie and those hot Pussycats

50
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,660
They make me horny
Saturday morning

51
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,970
Girls of cartoons
Won't leave me in ruins

52
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,200
I want to be Betty's Barney

53
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,010
Hey, Jane, get me off
this crazy thing...

54
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,640
caIled Iove.

55
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,510
Can I help you?

56
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,050
Yes. Do you have haggis?

57
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,210
Yes, we do. One?

58
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,420
Yes, please.
My parents are Scottish.

59
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,960
That'll be $19.75.

60
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,590
Here.

61
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,870
Oh, thank you.

62
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,630
Anything else?

63
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,300
No, thanks.

64
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,110
Thanks.

65
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,740
S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y night

66
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,600
Dance?

67
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:40,780
Heed, turn off the Bay City Rollers.
The soccer game's about to begin.

68
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,990
- HelIo!
- Hi!

69
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,090
We're in here, Son.

70
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,530
- Hey, Charlie.
- WiIlie, how's it going?

71
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,370
Give your mother a kiss
or l'll kick your teeth in.

72
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,070
Hey!
Did you happen to see

73
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,630
- The most beautiful girl
- May, shut it!

74
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,680
- How you doing, Dad?
- l'm doing fine.

75
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,510
- Come on, CharIie.
- Go with your mother.

76
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,180
While you're there,
why don't you try one of her bras on?

77
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,350
Float away, you fairy!

78
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,420
Mom, I brought you guys a haggis.

79
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,630
That's sweet of you, son.
Thank you.

80
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,800
I haven't seen one of these
for years.

81
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,900
l hate them,
but your father will happily--

82
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,410
Look at him. He's giving Tony...

83
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,910
alI that Lyndon H. LaRouche
rubbish again!

84
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,850
lt's a well-known fact
that there's a secret society...

85
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,220
ot the five wealthiest peopIe
known as the Pentavirate...

86
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:57,320
who run everything in the world
including the newspapers...

87
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,160
and meet triannualLy at
a secret country mansion in Colorado...

88
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,720
known as The Meadows.

89
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,960
Who's in this Pentavirate?

90
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,270
The queen, the Vatican, the Gettys...

91
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:13,040
the Rothschilds and ColoneI Sanders
before he went tits up.

92
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:17,480
l hated the CoLonel
with his wee beady eyes...

93
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:23,040
and that smug Iook on his face,
''You're gonna buy my chicken.''

94
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,280
How can you hate the Colonel?

95
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,550
Because he puts an addictive chemical
in his chicken...

96
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,420
that makes you crave it fortnightly,
smartass.

97
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,990
Interesting. Cuckoo!

98
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,990
WouLd you like a juice?

99
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,240
Look at what I bought myself.
A Juice Tiger.

100
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,170
A Juice Tiger.

101
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,370
I juice everything now.
I'm on a new diet.

102
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,350
I'm on my Weekly World News
Garth Brooks Juice Diet.

103
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,940
Score!

104
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,580
Magic! One, nil.

105
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,320
Let's have a look at the replay.

106
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,190
WiIliam, move your head.

107
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,520
Look at the size of that boy's head.

108
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,030
L'm not kidding.
It's like an orange on a toothpick.

109
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,660
- You're gonna give the boy a complex.
- That's a huge noggin!

110
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,540
That's a virtual planetoid.
Has its own weather system.

111
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,700
Heed, move!

112
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,110
Your Sherry's late.

113
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,480
Mom, Sherry and I broke up.

114
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,490
Not Sherry?

115
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,820
l Iiked Sherry.

116
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,160
Didn't like some of the other girls
you brought home, but L liked Sherry.

117
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,820
Don't make it any harder for me.

118
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,300
Why should I make it any easier?

119
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,030
You were good together.
You know that, you and Sherry.

120
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,130
l thought you might get married.

121
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,700
You know l'm terrified
of marriage.

122
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,610
l know that, son.

123
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:02,210
There's something to be said for not
marrying. Did you read the paper today?

124
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,910
- No.
- No?

125
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,650
Where did l put it?
Stuart?

126
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,520
Bring in the paper.

127
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,420
AIl right, hen.

128
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,190
Heed, paper! Now!

129
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,320
Move that melon of yours,
and get the paper if you can.

130
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,930
Hauling that gargantuan cranium about.

131
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,530
L'm not kidding.
That boy's head's like Sputnik.

132
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,100
SphericaL, but pointy in parts.

133
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,970
That was offsides, wasn't it?

134
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,980
He'll be crying himseIf to sleep tonight
on his huge pillow.

135
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:39,080
l find it interesting that you refer
to the Weekly World News as "'the paper.''

136
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,280
The paper contains facts.

137
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,490
This paper contains facts.

138
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,460
And this paper has the eighth highest
circulation in the world.

139
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,120
Plenty of facts.

140
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,400
''Pregnant Man Gives Birth!''

141
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,400
That's a fact.

142
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,370
Here it is. Look.

143
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,400
''Mrs. X, the honeymoon murderer.

144
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,780
She marries men under fake identities...

145
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,050
and then she murders them.''

146
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,750
She's murdered three men already.

147
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,120
Victim #1 was a Iounge singer.

148
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,820
Victim #2,
a Russian martial arts expert.

149
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,450
No!

150
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:26,930
And she's aIso kiIled a plumber
named Ralph ElIiot.

151
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:33,970
And her whereabouts are unknown.

152
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,780
You're in my eyes
You're in my dreams

153
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,720
You are my eyes
You are my dreams

154
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,030
You're in my eyes

155
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,230
you're Celtic, united

156
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:03,640
I've decided you're the best thing
that has happened to me

157
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,200
Give me a kiss.
Cheer me up. Good night.

158
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,140
Good night.

159
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,580
You've turned into a sexy wee bastard.
Do you know that?

160
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,280
Thanks, Mrs. Mackenzie.

161
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,020
- Hasn't he?
- I think so.

162
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,460
- Good night, Mom.
- Night.

163
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,790
- Good night, Dad.
- Bye, Mr. Mackenzie.

164
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,660
Fine, go.
You've stayed your hour.

165
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,130
- We're off.
- Good night.

166
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,470
Oh, yes!

167
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,250
- Good morning, CharLes.
- Good morning, sir.

168
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:34,130
- Are you working on the forms--
- Yes, Captain.

169
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,560
Tony?

170
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,640
I don't want to intrude,
but you seem a Iittle down.

171
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:49,770
Captain, it's about my job.

172
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,340
l'm having doubts about being a cop.

173
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,410
lt's not like how it is on TV.

174
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:01,120
All L do all day is filI out forms
and paperwork.

175
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,890
lt's a point well taken,
but understand...

176
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,260
although it's not exciting,
it's an important part of our work.

177
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,820
Yeah, but in all my time as a cop...

178
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,360
l've never chased a guy
across a crowded city square.

179
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,430
l've never hung on to that part
of the helicopter.

180
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,570
Do you know the part underneath
where it lands?

181
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,080
- Yes, l know that part.
- L've never hung on to that.

182
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,740
l've never even commandeered
a vehicIe.

183
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,080
That sounds like a Lot of fun.

184
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,780
That's the other thing.
You're too nice.

185
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,180
- I'm too nice?
- Yes, you're too nice!

186
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,460
Why can't you be Like the captain
on Starsky and Hutch...

187
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:44,230
where you haul me into your office,
and you bawI me out...

188
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,890
because you're tired of defending
my screwball antics to the commissioner?

189
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,900
Why can't you do that?

190
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:52,930
l don't report to a commissioner.
l report to a committee.

191
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:57,000
Some appointed, some elected and some
co-opted on a biannual basis.

192
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,210
- It's a quorum.
- A quorum?

193
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,710
Yeah.

194
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,150
When l joined the police force,
I thought l would be Serpico.

195
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,190
But instead, l'm like Fish
from Barney Miller.

196
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,620
Hey, somebody needs a hug!

197
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,020
l can't do that.

198
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,380
Haggis, right?

199
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,610
Right. L'm the guy
who ordered the haggis.

200
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,820
May l ask you a question?
Do you actually like haggis?

201
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,120
No. I think it's repelIent.

202
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,130
I think most Scottish cuisine
is based on a dare.

203
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,130
- L'm next.
- You're next.

204
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,400
- Okay. How can l heIp you?
- l'll tell you.

205
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:59,430
All l want is one New York strip steak
a quarter inch thick.

206
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,940
That's all l want.
No more, no less.

207
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,940
Get the steak
and Iet me get out of here.

208
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,610
l'm sorry. l'm really busy now.

209
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,510
- Busy, eh?
- lt's insane today.

210
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,780
My dad's a butcher.

211
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,880
I used to work at his shop.
l can help.

212
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,400
I'd love some help. Great.
What's your name?

213
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,130
- My name's Charlie.
- Hi. Harriet.

214
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,330
Could you get me four porterhouses
in the fridge?

215
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,870
Do you live in New York?
ReaIly?

216
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,420
Just teLl me if that's still tense.

217
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,890
You guide me.

218
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:01,490
Mom, can you get the schooI nurse?

219
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,790
Get the school nurse!
Help me!

220
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,730
There was an accident in shop.

221
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,400
Get the school nurse.
Get me a tourniquet.

222
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,500
Anything!

223
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,820
l want to thank you
for heIping me out today.

224
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,850
You were reaIly nice.

225
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,450
Oh, l was nice!
Nice.

226
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,290
EvidentIy you think of me
as a woman friend.

227
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,820
- What is wrong with being nice?
- Nothing.

228
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,060
Charlie, name one bad thing
you've done.

229
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,130
I've done bad things.
But let's taIk about you.

230
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,200
TeLl me one bad thing you've done,
and it better be evil.

231
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,680
How evil?

232
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:55,380
Really evil. So evil
that you would say it was evil.

233
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:59,350
Like it's the fruits
of the deviI. Evil.

234
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:04,750
For example. How many peopIe
have you brutalIy murdered?

235
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,590
Brutal's a very subjective word.

236
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:14,930
What's brutal to one person might be
totaIly reasonable to somebody eIse.

237
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:53,470
Do you know Russian?

238
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,470
Yeah.

239
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:00,710
Oh, thiS hurts.
No, this is hard.

240
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:04,080
'Cause not only are you
extremely good-Iooking...

241
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,380
but you're also very, very smart.

242
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,890
That's no fair.
That's hard.

243
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,490
- Bright women intimidate you?
- No, no. Not at aIl.

244
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,020
But it's a shame
l'm going to have to destroy you.

245
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,830
Come here.

246
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:29,600
Nadia, l am coming.

247
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,180
Expand. Contract. Expand.

248
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,550
Wait. What do you Iook for
in a woman you date?

249
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:46,930
WelI, I know everyone says
sense of humor...

250
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,960
but I'd realIy have to go
with breast size.

251
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,630
Oh, my God!

252
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,000
Come! Let us dance
like children of the night.

253
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:08,680
- Here we are.
- Wow! What a great place.

254
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,120
- I'Il make us some tea?
- Sure.

255
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,660
Show yourself around.

256
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:24,190
You know what this place needs? A large,
oversized poster of Atlantic City.

257
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:30,200
- Look! You got one!
- I used to live there.

258
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:35,440
Some herbaI teas. Cubby Wubby
Woom Room tea and Morning Thunder.

259
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,740
I'll go with
the Cubby Wubby Woom Room Tea.

260
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,580
All right. Thanks.

261
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,790
What's this?

262
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,630
l had a friend.
He was a martial arts expert.

263
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,200
- You had a friend?
- lt's a martial arts thing.

264
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,370
I took it up, and thought
it would Iook good on the waLl.

265
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,540
Oh, it does.

266
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,580
Scotland has its own martial arts.

267
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,580
lt's called ''fuck you!''

268
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,760
lt's mostly head-butting and kicking
people when they're on the ground.

269
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:37,300
- It's late?
- Not for me.

270
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,070
Who for then?

271
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,270
''Who for then'' what?

272
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,800
When you said it wasn't late for you,
I was wondering who it was Iate for.

273
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,040
Not me. No, no.

274
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,410
I Iike the nightIife.
I Iike to boogie.

275
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,120
L'Ll make the tea then.

276
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,040
You know...

277
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,870
maybe it is late.

278
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,040
l'll be honest with you.
l had a reaLly great time tonight.

279
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,610
And l'd reaIly Iove to kiss you,
but I think...

280
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,380
if l kiss you,
we'll end up kissing on the couch.

281
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,620
lf we end up kissing on the couch,
chances are we'Il kiss in the bedroom.

282
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:35,820
lf we kiss in the bedroom,
that's the part l always rush into.

283
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:40,700
I just don't think it's a good idea to
rush into spending the night together.

284
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,740
l want to spend the night together.

285
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,330
l have no problem with that.

286
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,010
You're it!

287
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,550
Come here.

288
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,330
Yes!

289
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,270
Ralph !

290
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:20,100
l will. l will.

291
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,300
Oh. Wait. Not now. Not now.

292
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,640
RaIph! Ralph !

293
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,020
You were having a dream.

294
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,190
And you kept saying the name Ralph.

295
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:46,960
Yeah. You kept saying the name Ralph.

296
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,770
She's my friend.

297
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,940
She's your friend.

298
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,310
Ralph.

299
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,350
She's your friend.

300
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,820
RaIph. She.

301
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,480
l'm sorry! l thought
you were somebody eIse. Sorry.

302
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,710
l'm Harriet's friend, Charlie.

303
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,690
And you must be RaIph?

304
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,160
I'm Harriet's sister Rose.

305
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,250
Harriet gave me a note to give to you.

306
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,760
Great.

307
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,360
Make yourself at home.

308
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:31,130
And thanks for the hot dog.
Harriet.''

309
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,700
WelL, that's a very nice note.

310
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,010
Let me make you some breakfast.

311
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,710
I'd love to, but I'm running late.
But thanks.

312
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,310
What would you say
to siIver dollar pancakes...

313
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:48,820
fresh-squeezed orange juice,
bacon, and Kona coffee?

314
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,380
It sounds great.

315
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,160
Sorry. l didn't have
those other things.

316
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:03,030
No, that's fine.
That other stuff will probably kill you.

317
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,940
Whereas Fruit Loops are Iight
and reasonabIy high in fiber.

318
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,240
l care for Apple Jacks
a great deal.

319
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,840
Got them.

320
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,280
Good.

321
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,250
ls this your place?

322
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,260
No, this is our place,
Harriet's and mine.

323
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,660
She just sort of comes and goes,
but she always ends up here.

324
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,530
She didn't speak of me?

325
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:34,540
No, she didn't speak of you.

326
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,540
She talked about a martiaI arts guy
and some discussion about Ralph.

327
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:43,600
Oh, really?
She spoke about them.

328
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,240
She taLked about the martiaI arts guy...

329
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,610
and actuaIly she kind of shouted Ralph.

330
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,950
Sorry.

331
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,290
Oh, weIl.
You know Harriet.

332
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,160
Actually l don't.

333
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:07,000
- But you did have sex with her.
- HelIo!

334
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,660
I'm gonna go.

335
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:16,140
l'm not gonna tell Harriet
that anything happened.

336
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,730
Rose.

337
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,910
Nothing did happen.

338
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:28,180
Don't worry, CharLie.
Just be careful.

339
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,660
Sounds like you really like this girl.

340
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,330
I'm smitten.
I am in deep smit.

341
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,430
She is wonderful!

342
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,270
We shouldn't talk about it,
because l'lI start to analyze it.

343
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,140
That's no good.

344
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:25,310
That is good! You should
just Let it happen, relax.

345
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:29,650
HelIo, everyone. L am a park ranger.
l wilI be leading you on the tour.

346
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,210
All the park rangers at Alcatraz were
at one time guards, myself included.

347
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:37,950
My name is John Johnson,
but everyone here caIls me Vicki.

348
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,650
Please follow me.

349
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:43,930
- l love Vicki. He's a great guy.
- He's the best.

350
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,760
This is the main celI block area.

351
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,200
Home to such famous criminals
as AI Capone...

352
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:54,440
Mickey Cohen, Joseph '"Dutch'' Cretzer...

353
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:59,070
and Robert Stroud,
the famous Birdman of Alcatraz.

354
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,340
Tony, this time
it's gonna be different.

355
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,650
If something strange happens,
l'm just gonna let it go.

356
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,210
lt's not my business.
For example, Ralph.

357
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:11,620
She says ""RaIph'' in her sleep.
So what?

358
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,130
This is the celI
for solitary confinement...

359
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,690
that over the years had come
to be known as ""Times Square.''

360
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:20,330
Make sure everyone gets a Iook.

361
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,840
Who's RaIph?

362
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:27,810
l don't know, and more importantly,
l don't want to know.

363
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,570
That's good.

364
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,770
Did you and Harriet "'you know''
last night?

365
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:36,150
AlL right, dirtbag,
all you have to know...

366
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,150
is that Harriet is a sweet, kind
and loving person.

367
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,160
That's good. That's nice.

368
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,120
- And, yes, we did.
- AIl right!

369
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,890
Close it up, close it up.

370
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,100
This is something the other tour guides
won't tell you.

371
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:02,930
ln this ceIl bIock, ""Machine Gun'' KeIly
had what we call in the prison system...

372
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:05,340
a '"bitch.''

373
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:10,910
One night in a jealous rage,
KelIy took a makeshift knife or shiv...

374
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:14,480
and cut out the bitch's eyes.

375
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,190
Another thing about Harriet--

376
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:30,560
And as if this wasn't
enough retribution for Kelly...

377
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,440
the next day he and
four other inmates took turns...

378
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:39,500
pissing into
the bitch's ocular cavities.

379
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,680
This way to the cafeteria.

380
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,450
Tony, l'm really happy.

381
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,860
PLease, don't Let me
screw this one up.

382
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:56,190
- I'Il try.
- Alrighty.

383
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:05,090
Okay, l got another one.
What's worse?

384
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:09,690
Your cabIe goes out and you're left
with synchronized swimming on ESPN...

385
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,360
or--

386
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,040
You're stuck on the Bay Bridge
in traffic...

387
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:21,240
and you just had two strong cups
of coffee and three bran muffins.

388
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,240
Hello! Hello.

389
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,910
l have a good one.
What's worse?

390
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:32,430
You go to your favorite restaurant
and order your favorite meal.

391
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:37,060
You take your first bite and
under the steak is a scabby Band-Aid...

392
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,820
or--

393
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,060
Or, or, or...

394
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,970
being electrocuted.

395
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,270
And--

396
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,280
And that's it.
Being electrocuted.

397
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,650
L was electrocuted once.
lt was horrible.

398
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,980
That's a crying shame.

399
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,690
Hi. Can we get our check, please?
Thanks a Iot.

400
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,760
- l'll get that.
- l got it.

401
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:21,140
No, l got it. l insist.
Let me pick up the check.

402
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,770
- No infinity.
- Come on.

403
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,240
- "'Negatory,'' good buddy.
- You're embarrassing me.

404
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,750
Negatory.

405
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,610
l'll pick up the check.

406
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,780
What do you say we catch a cab?

407
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,990
- I'd like to walk.
- lt's raining!

408
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:43,150
- I'd like to walk.
- Me too.

409
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:47,100
- AlI right, fine. See you Iater.
- Bye.

410
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:57,180
- lt's officialIy raining.
- Just a drizzle.

411
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,610
You know, I love that you wanted
to walk in the rain.

412
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:06,040
I'm reaIly gIad you're gonna meet
my parents tomorrow night.

413
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,180
You know what, Charlie?

414
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:12,090
lt's the strangest thing,
but l feel realIy safe with you...

415
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,750
Iike in old movies
when peopLe never left each other.

416
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:18,320
They stayed together forever.

417
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,320
- lt's a great house.
- They moved in the day they married.

418
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:43,350
ln two weeks, l'm throwing them
a 30th wedding anniversary party.

419
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,530
Mom, Dad, we're here.

420
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,300
Stuart!

421
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:05,740
Charlie, is this the wee Harriet?

422
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:09,580
She's absolutely beautiful!

423
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:12,080
And you're very, very weIcome.

424
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,210
I hope you hold on to this one.

425
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:18,050
You have the face of a wee angel.
Do you know that?

426
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:22,590
- L give! l'm Charlie's father.
- Yeah.

427
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:27,190
l'm sorry. You surprised me.

428
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:31,710
l like this one.
She's quite a filIy.

429
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,540
Charlie tells me you're a butcher.

430
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,910
Yes, l am a butcher.

431
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,100
Do you Iink your own sausage?

432
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,240
As a matter of fact, I do.

433
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,980
- Why don't you put your trousers on?
- Hold your horses.

434
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,420
Heed, pants, now!

435
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,550
Why don't you come with me?

436
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:56,460
l have wonderful photographs of him
when he was a wee baby.

437
00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:00,020
Show her the picture of Charlie
when he shit his pants at Niagara Falls.

438
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,660
Mom, don't show her the pictures.

439
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:07,330
Lighten up!
You got a pickIe up your ass again.

440
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:15,380
l'm gonna go to the washroom.

441
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,820
Evidently l have
a pickle up my ass.

442
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:20,650
You're gonna be okay
if I leave you alone?

443
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,850
Fine. Don't worry about me.

444
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,390
Make sure there's enough paper.

445
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,490
And, Charlie, light a match.

446
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:33,630
Are you about to crap again?

447
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,870
What a cute baby Charlie was!

448
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,380
You okay in there, Charlie?
You didn't falI in, did you?

449
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:35,420
l can't believe the resembIance
between you and Charlie.

450
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,930
Thank you.

451
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,900
Enough about us.

452
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:42,160
Tell me something about yourself.

453
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,140
Have you aIways lived
in San Francisco?

454
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,040
No. Actually I moved around
quite a bit.

455
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,420
I had a really great time
with your family tonight.

456
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,630
Oh, great.

457
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,130
You know that
martial arts expert friend you had?

458
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,070
Was that here in San Francisco?

459
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,920
No. ActuaIly it was Miami.

460
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:38,820
Your family's really great.
When your mother took out that book--

461
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:42,590
Was that before or after
Atlantic City?

462
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:47,000
It's a period of my life
l don't Iike talking about.

463
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:53,400
CharLie, I hated Atlantic City.

464
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,640
lt's a town full
of gamblers and lounge singers.

465
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:15,160
Ralph, no.

466
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,470
Tony, have you heard of this?
Mrs. X.

467
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:33,040
She murders her husbands, then changes
her identity and marries again.

468
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,080
l never heard of it.
So what?

469
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:40,380
I think l'm dating Mrs. X.

470
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,380
Two words.

471
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,900
Therapy.

472
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:56,060
She told me she dated
a martial arts expert.

473
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:00,440
It says that one of the victims
was a martial arts expert.

474
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:04,970
Last night she put a kung fu move
on my dad and tried to break his neck.

475
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:08,810
A thousand people tried to break your
father's neck. Should I arrest them?

476
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,410
WeIl, yes.

477
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,280
Look. ''Ralph ElIiot.

478
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:19,550
Plumber from Dallas.
Missing since his honeymoon.''

479
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:23,720
- You're just getting scared.
- Yes.

480
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,390
You think Harriet couId be the one,
so you start to suspect her of things...

481
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:31,730
because you're scared you'lI marry,
and to you marriage is death.

482
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:35,570
Tony, just read it, okay?
Read it?

483
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,910
Just read it.

484
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:48,240
- ""Larry Leonard, 'croner'--''
- Crooner.

485
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:52,950
'"Made a name for himseIf being able
to sing in six languages 'OnIy You.'''

486
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:54,290
Yes. See?

487
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,260
Charlie, does Harriet even know
the words to '"OnIy You''?

488
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:00,530
I don't know.
We haven't reached that critical...

489
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,540
""Do you know the words to 'Only You'?''
phase in our relationship.

490
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,600
I'm afraid l'm not much help.

491
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:10,440
You've got to move past this.
I'm worried about you.

492
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:14,810
You're starting to live your life
according to the Weekly World News.

493
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,650
lt's the eighth highest
circulating paper in the world.

494
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,520
Look. Mrs. X. PIease.

495
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:26,120
Look it up, okay?
For me?

496
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,920
lndulge me?

497
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,290
No, there's no record of any deaths.

498
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:36,300
All three were reported missing during
their honeymoon, but so were the wives.

499
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:40,930
No picture of any brides.
For all we know, they moved away.

500
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:44,540
That's true.
You're just gonna have to reaIize that.

501
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,550
l personally wouId lie to you...

502
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,640
but Cathy has this crazy notion
of always telling the truth.

503
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,380
Understood.

504
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:54,250
- You feel better now?
- I guess so.

505
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,650
Good! Come on.

506
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:05,460
Hello, l'm Maureen O'Boyle.
Welcome to A Current Affair.

507
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,900
Tonight, "Amy, Did She or Didn't She?"

508
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:12,340
Then the reptile that took
Hollywood by storm...

509
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,240
First, the Justice Department
reports an alarming rise...

510
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:22,710
in the number of poisoning murders
across the United States.

511
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:31,550
A scourge which seems to be reaching
into every home.

512
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:35,390
Steve Dunleavy examines poison murders.
Steve?

513
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:39,360
The most common form of poisoning
occurs between couples...

514
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:42,160
for reasons as varied
as insurance fraud...

515
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,470
old-fashioned jealousy
and simple psychopathic behavior.

516
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,750
l have a surprise for you.

517
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,110

I have kitten breath.

524
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,770
Why don't you just taste it?

525
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,400
It's got strawberries.
You Iove strawberries.

526
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,440
L spent 20 minutes making it.
Just take a sip.

527
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:27,500
- No, l'm just gonna go.
- Try it. One sip wouldn't hurt you.

528
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:37,550
Fine. Forget it.

529
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:23,400
I'm sorry.

530
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:25,870
That's okay.

531
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:29,840
l'm just sensitive.

532
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:34,510
l mean, you didn't drink my shake.
So what? Right?

533
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:39,210
You spent half an hour on it.
L understand.

534
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:42,260
You know what? Let's scratch. Scratch.

535
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,880
Scratch?

536
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,020
Yeah, let's do a little scratching.

537
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,990
Yeah, there you go. Scratching.

538
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,190
- Here. GoIden Gate Bridge.
- Golden.

539
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:55,430
- Okay, Presidio. Union Square.
- Got it.

540
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,090
Little Japan.

541
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:59,160
Union Square.

542
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,900
Oakland.

543
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,510
Can you reach around
and get Coit Tower?

544
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,370
San Andreas Fault.

545
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:11,280
You know what l like best about you?

546
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:15,220
I can tell you anything in the world,
and you don't judge me.

547
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:18,720
Charlie, have you ever...

548
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,760
stood at the edge...

549
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:25,030
of a cliff or subway platform
with someone...

550
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:28,970
and you thought
just for a spLit second...

551
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,000
""What if l pushed him?''

552
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:32,500
Not reaIly.

553
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:35,670
UsuaIly I foIlow the Judeo-Christian
ethic of ''Thou shalt not kilI.''

554
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:39,610
- But that's just me.
- l know.

555
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,480
l'm just making a point of how many
times we trust people with our lives.

556
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:45,210
Look at us!

557
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:48,350
We're sleeping,
and look how vuInerable we are.

558
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,360
I could do anything to you
in your sleep.

559
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,760
What could you do?

560
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:55,820
You know. Anything.

561
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:59,660
You're totally asIeep,
l could just...

562
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:02,400
oh, stick a needIe in--

563
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:09,770
Charlie, Jesus!

564
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,300
l'm just trying to show you
what a good reIationship we havel

565
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:16,440
I'm sorry. It's just
L have an ear thing. Okay?

566
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,750
There was an episode of Night Gallery.

567
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,620
This guy put an earwig
in the guy's ear.

568
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:23,880
They said, '"The good news is
we got the earwig...

569
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,390
but the bad news is
it was a female.''

570
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:30,290
I'm sorry.
l just have an ear thing.

571
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,300
- Just good night.
- l'm sorry.

572
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:38,090
- l'm a human bIanket.
- Get off of me. Just good night.

573
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,880
Good night.

574
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:08,830
Yes, sir. Can I help you?

575
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,430
Yes. l'd like to pLace an announcement.

576
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,600
lt's my parents'
30th wedding anniversary.

577
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:16,940
Sure.
That's 4.50 per word.

578
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:20,880
And you've got a choice
of standard or bold.

579
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:23,250
Well, you havin'
a busy week, Frank?

580
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,610
Nah.
Just these two.

581
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:27,620
lt's been dead around here.

582
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:33,150
L got this one here, a tourist.
Heart attack on a cable car.

583
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:35,490
The guy Ieft his heart
in San Francisco.

584
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:43,330
That's a real person
you're talking about.

585
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,670
All right, I'm sorry.

586
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:49,370
There's another one here. Native
San Franciscan. Plumber. EIliot, RaIph.

587
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:54,210
Moved to Dallas.
Disappeared four months ago.

588
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,210
The body was found in a sewer.

589
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,220
Well, a guy
takes his job too seriously...

590
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:01,380
his life goes down the drain.

591
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:07,890
Did they mention anything
about his wife?

592
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:12,730
Okay. Look, I know we're talkin'
about real people here, so I'm sorry.

593
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,130
No, no, l'm serious.
Did they mention the wife?

594
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,140
Look, l'm sorry, you know?

595
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,070
l didn't mean to make a joke
about other people's Iives.

596
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:23,770
I'm reaIly serious. Did they
mention the wife? I just wanna know.

597
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,280
- You win, okay? l'm a bad person.
- Take it easy.

598
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:29,340
No, he's sayin' l'm insensitive.
He's sayin' l'm a shit.

599
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:31,350
He's not sayin' you're a shit.

600
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:33,220
Did they mention the wife?

601
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:37,850
No, no, they didn't mention the wife!
You happy?

602
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,690
Oh, yes, yes, l'm insensitive!
l'm a very insensitive man !

603
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,560
Stop your job!
Look at the insensitive man!

604
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:47,570
That's what
they're payin' you for!

605
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,930
He was my ride home.

606
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,970
Understood.

607
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:02,340
What's goin' on that you had
to see me so urgently?

608
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:04,680
You couldn't even come
to my apartment?

609
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:07,080
lt's just safer here.

610
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:10,450
What? Charlie.

611
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:14,420
I'm sorry.

612
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:16,930
I think you're
a terrific woman.

613
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:21,300
l just don't think
we should see each other anymore.

614
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,130
Why? TeIl me the truth.

615
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:33,600
I'm afraid that you're gonna k--
leave me.

616
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,450
l'm gonna "'cleave'' you?
What does that mean, Charlie?

617
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,990
No, no, Ieave me, Ieave me.
Not ""cleave me.''

618
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,990
That you're gonna reject me,
you know?

619
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:46,320
So, I just thought l'd do
a preemptive strike.

620
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,590
So you're rejecting me?

621
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:53,060
l didn't mean to hurt you.

622
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:56,330
I never wanted to hurt you.

623
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,370
Don't worry. You haven't.

624
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,270
At least you Ieft early on.

625
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:08,350
So...

626
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:10,350
that's it then?

627
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:17,290
'Cause l gotta get back to work.

628
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:01,860
Woman

629
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:03,870
Woe-man

630
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:06,910
Whoa, man

631
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,940
We had love
Not just sex

632
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:10,530
ls she Mrs. X

633
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:13,550
l had to run for my life

634
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:27,860
Jane, get me off
of this crazy thing...

635
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:29,860
caIled Iove.

636
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,290
HelIo?

637
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:09,890
Hey! Not that it matters anymore...

638
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:11,900
but I thought
that you might Iike to know.

639
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:14,440
Somebody just turned themseIves in
for the murder of Ralph ELliot.

640
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:16,770
- What about the other murders?
- I don't know.

641
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,780
So far she just confessed
to the one murder.

642
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:23,280
Look, anyway, crime to stop.
Gotta go. Catch you later. All right?

643
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:46,470
- Harriet! lt's me, Charlie!
- Go away, Charlie.

644
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:49,270
Harriet, l gotta talk to you.
l made a big mistake.

645
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,670
lt's me.
l'm just a big idiot.

646
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:55,510
l'm gonna go into therapy, okay?
l'll go twice a week.

647
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:59,110
l don't know if my insurance is gonna
cover it, but l'lI taIk to the guy.

648
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:03,320
What is it, Charlie?

649
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:05,880
Hi, CharIie.

650
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,070
l don't wanna lose you.

651
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:20,630
You didn't.
You rejected me.

652
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:23,730
Okay, I'm unrejecting you.

653
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:30,710
You'Il do it again, CharIie.
You will do it again.

654
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,720
No. No, I'm not gonna do it again.

655
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:39,080
Look, l got scared, okay?

656
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:43,930
Things were going reaIly good,
then l just got scared, all right?

657
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:51,100
l love you.

658
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:56,170
l love you, too.

659
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,820
But you blew it, CharIie.
You blew it.

660
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:30,130
Harriet, Harr-i-et

661
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:34,170
Hard-hearted harbinger
of haggis

662
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:37,880
Beautiful, bemus-ed

663
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:41,150
Bellicose butcher

664
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:43,150
Un-trust-ing

665
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,760
Un-know-ing

666
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:51,130
Un-lov-ed

667
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:01,200
"He wants you back,"
he screamed into the night air

668
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:04,710
Like a fireman going to a window
that has no fire

669
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:13,350
Except the passion
of his heart

670
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:15,350
I am lonely

671
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,890
lt's really hard

672
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:23,290
This poem sucks

673
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,970
I'm sorry l didn't trust you.

674
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:11,580
Hey, Harriet.
Somebody's downstairs to see ya.

675
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:15,850
Uh, she'll be down
in a moment, actually. Yes.

676
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:20,080
And could you bring the car around?
Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

677
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:23,920
Charlie! Come here.
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

678
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:25,920

699
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:06,950
Thirty years ago today, May and l
were married. Some of you were there.

700
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:08,960
Some of you weren't born.

701
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:12,490
And some of you are now dead.

702
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:15,830
But we both said, ""l do.''

703
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,990
And we haven't agreed
on a single thing since.

704
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:20,130
lt's true.

705
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:23,880
But I'm glad l married you, May...

706
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:27,440
because it could've been worse.

707
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:33,180
And besides...

708
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,220

768
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:23,830
She's the best. She's incredibLe.
You've been a chicken with commitment.

FinalIy you met the right girl.
That's great.

770
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:29,750
l mean, how couLd you ever have thought
that this girl was a murderer?

771
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:33,250
Only you

772
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:37,950
Can make this world seem right

773
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:41,930
Only you

774
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:43,260

775
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:46,820
The darkness bright

01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:31,470
l understand

785
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:36,140
The magic that you bring

786
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:41,150
You're my dream come true

787
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:43,380
My one

788
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:49,360

A lot of the beat poets

01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:22,260
Well, you're reaIly quiet.

792
01:09:22,330 --> 01:09:25,730
l'm just thinking.
That's alI.

793
01:09:27,170 --> 01:09:30,930
Why don't I do the talking for you?

794
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,560
Hi, my name is Harriet.

795
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,570
Hi, Harriet. How's it going?

796
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:38,440
Good.
Good, l suppose.

797
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:42,000
l think you're great, Charlie.
Everything you do is art.

798
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:46,520
You're a sex machine.
Get on the scene with the sex machine.

799
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:49,210
Thank you very much.
That's very kind of you.

800
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:51,720
You're the best husband

801
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:55,920
- Why did you just say that?
- l was just-- lt was a joke.

802
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:58,520
No. What do you mean by it?
Why did you say that?

803
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,760
Because I thought
it might be funny.

804
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:04,930
Nothing. L just think
you're a great person. That's all.

805
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,630
What?

806
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:08,800
You're the best.

807
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:23,920
Boys upstairs say you've been sticking
your nose in the Ralph Elliot case.

808
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:26,620
- Yes, Captain.
- Don't ""Yes, Captain'' me!

809
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:28,850
Stay out of this.
This is strictIy homicide.

810
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:31,900
- But l got these friends--
- We aLl got these friends.

811
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:33,960
l'm warning you, Giardino.

812
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:36,230
Back off, ltalian boy.

813
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,960
Keep away from this one.
It's too big for ya!

814
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:42,940
Wait a minute, Captain. Trust me.
I know what l'm taIkin' about.

815
01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:48,380
- What's the newS?
- You wanna hear the news? Here it is.

816
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:51,680
lt seems that the old lady who confessed
to the murder of Ralph Elliot...

817
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:53,720
has also confessed
to a couple of other murders.

818
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:55,720
- l knew she wouId. I knew it.
- Yeah, right!

819
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:57,980
WeLl, she's confessed to the murders
of Abraham LincoIn...

820
01:10:58,060 --> 01:11:00,050
Warren G. Harding and Julius Caesar.

821
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:02,320
She's a nut case! A nut case!

822
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:04,920
Oh, my God.
l gotta go.

823
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:11,530
You screw this one up, and you'lI
be writing parking tickets. Got that?

824
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:15,770
Captain, l won't let you down.

825
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:24,110
Good for you.
That was so much better.

826
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:27,120
- Yeah? You Iiked it?
- RealIy terrific. lt was fantastic.

827
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:29,210
- The beginning felt pretty good.
- Yeah, it was great.

828
01:11:29,290 --> 01:11:32,590
- l did too much in the end.
- No, it was realIy terrific.

829
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:34,630
I'd like to discuss this,
but l gotta save a life.

830
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:37,180
- l'lL work on it.
- Work on it because it was terrific.

831
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:40,390
And honestIy, it was
such a big improvement. Fantastic!

832
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:42,060
Thanks.

833
01:12:01,290 --> 01:12:04,080
That is Ralph Elliot's wife.

834
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:08,120
Of course, her hair
was much shorter then.

835
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:11,650
Mrs. Karpov has gained
a lot of weight since then...

836
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:14,630
but it's definitely her.

837
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,670
Yeah, yeah,
that's his little lollipop.

838
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:18,670
Boy, he was really in love with her.

839
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:22,900
But I'll telI ya, she was a Iot of fun.
And smart. Doll-faced too.

840
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:41,220
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

841
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,530
This is reaIly cooI.

842
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:49,670
Hi.

843
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:52,470
Mr. and Mrs. Mackenzie,
please enjoy your honeymoon.

844
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:56,130
For us, when you leave,
it will be far too soon.

845
01:12:56,210 --> 01:12:59,370
Now, four nights.

846
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,380
- Your dinner reservations are at 9:00.
- Sounds great.

847
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:06,680
You might prepare some candles.
With a storm, we frequently lose power.

848
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:10,650
Oh, wow, that's so cool.
Did you hear that? A storm. A storm.

849
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,560
We'lI be all snugly inside.

850
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:15,560
You okay?

851
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:19,160
l have a headache.

852
01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:23,630
Excuse me? Do you have a drugstore
in the hoteI? l want to buy aspirin.

853
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:27,100
Right up those back stairs,
Mrs. Mackenzie. Anything you need.

854
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,170
Don't move.

855
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:37,210
- You reaLly think she's got a headache?
- What?

856
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:40,950
Nothing. Here's your key. Just as
you requested, the Robbie Burns room.

857
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:42,950
Oh, thanks.

858
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,990
The circuits are down
due to a storm.

859
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:56,360
Keep on tryin', all right?
Tell the chief that l chartered a plane.

860
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:01,200
- Hey! Paisane!
- What?

861
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:02,710
You screw up one more time...

862
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:04,970
I'm gonna kick your
spaghetti-bending butt back to Milan.

863
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:08,570
- Not now! Not now!
- Was it too much with the ethnic slurs?

864
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:11,910
lt was fine. But it's not paisane.
It's paisan!

865
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:15,080
Hey! Paisan!

866
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:51,150
Hey, listen! How long is it
gonna take us to get there?

867
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,160
Shouldn't take very long.

868
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:57,930
ActuaIly, l have no concept of time.

869
01:14:59,930 --> 01:15:03,560
- Gee, is this dangerous?
- No.

870
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:07,770
WelI, you know,
there's chance in everything.

871
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,640
Look, I don't wanna get too personal,
but you've done this before, right?

872
01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:14,150
Oh, yeah, yeah.
l do this all the time.

873
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:17,310
l've never done it at night.

874
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:36,590
Mr. and Mrs. Mackenzie.
GIad to see you.

875
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:38,600
FoIlow me, pIease.

876
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:52,310
How the heIl do you even know
if you're going in the right direction?

877
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:54,150
Instruments, instruments.

878
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:57,190
Oh, yeah, yeah!
What's that?

879
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:59,620
That's the artificial horizon...

880
01:15:59,690 --> 01:16:03,960
which is better
than the actual horizon.

881
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:08,590
Hey, you know what?
l'm gonna go wash my hands, alI right?

882
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:10,600
l love you.

883
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,220
What are you doing?
Wake up!

884
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:03,050
Oh, man !
l was having an amazing dream.

885
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:06,390
l don't care about your dream!
Land the plane!

886
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:11,230
l was just born...

887
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:14,160
and l was
eight-and-a-half months premature.

888
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:17,260
- The doctors started freakin' out.
- Shut up!

889
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:19,270
Did l aIready tell you this dream?

890
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:23,570
Can I get your attention?

891
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,610
L'd Iike to make
some special announcements.

892
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:28,840
Celebrating their 25th wedding
anniversary with us.

893
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:32,910
How about a nice hand
for Mr. and Mrs. Seymour Levenstein?

894
01:17:36,450 --> 01:17:39,550
Twenty-five years ago,
they were right here on their honeymoon.

895
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:43,920
Speaking of great honeymooning couples,
Charlie and Harriet Mackenzie.

896
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,730
- Aren't they a good-looking group?
- Sorry. There's a phone calI.

897
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,730
- They said it was quite urgent.
- Oh, thank you.

898
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,240
Sorry. HelIo?

899
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:56,100
Charlie, you okay?

900
01:17:56,170 --> 01:17:58,140
Great. CouIdn't be better.

901
01:17:58,210 --> 01:18:01,740
CharIie, listen to me.
Harriet is Mrs. X.

902
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:04,940
She killed Ralph and those
two other guys. l got a picture.

903
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:08,320
It checked out. It's her, Charlie.
She's the murderer.

904
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:11,250
I called the police. Roads are closed,
but they're on their way!

905
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:14,780
ln the meantime,
just stay where you are.

906
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:15,950
Charlie.

907
01:18:16,030 --> 01:18:19,660
Hold on, one second.
Excuse me, one second. What should I do?

908
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:22,290
Don't worry.
When the time comes, you'll know.

909
01:18:22,370 --> 01:18:24,600
Thanks. Thank you.

910
01:18:27,070 --> 01:18:29,060
HeLlo? HelIo? Hello?

- HelIo?
- CharIie, what happened?

913
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:38,250
I was on the phone, and it went dead.

914
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:41,180
lt's common.
The lines wilI be out until tomorrow.

916
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:44,250

Nothing happened.
The phone Iines went dead. That's aIl.

918
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:49,690
To this lovely couple,
we wish a long and beautifuI life.

919
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,520
I wanna play your song for you

920
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,690

921
01:18:57,470 --> 01:19:00,100
You have to wait
for the traditionaI wedding dance.

922
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:14,910
Excuse me, sir. I'm with
the San Francisco Police Department.

01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:13,270
Hey, this couple's had enough
of this crowd for one night.

932
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:15,680
They got more important things to do.
Huh?

933
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:18,680
Let's put 'em
in the honeymoon chair.

934
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:24,890
We did it on our honeymoon.

935

- Wait. Charlie. Charlie!

955
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:04,510
Would you mind not doing that?

956
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:06,850
This bothers you?

957
01:22:06,930 --> 01:22:09,860
No, it's one of my favorite things.

958
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:16,920

lt's too hard.
I'm leaving you.

963
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,050
Love, Charlie.''

964
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:43,750
l didn't write--

965
01:22:45,030 --> 01:22:47,730
What the fuck? Rose!

966
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:52,330

969
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,810
You're not

970
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,870
when this note has been written
and pLaced on the desk.

971
01:23:01,950 --> 01:23:03,410
Do you understand me?

972
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:07,940
You took her away from me, Charlie.
Like all the rest.

973
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:10,580
I have had it!

974
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:12,280
You...

975
01:23:13,630 --> 01:23:16,690
are going to die.

976
01:23:18,730 --> 01:23:20,720
Would you mind waiting for me?

977
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:23,790
I may have to apprehend somebody.
lf l have to take 'em into custody...

978
01:23:23,870 --> 01:23:26,060
l'm gonna need transportation

01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:28,070
Thank you.

980
01:23:29,470 --> 01:23:31,940

981
01:23:32,010 --> 01:23:34,270
Charlie, be careful!

982
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:43,980
Run, CharIie!

983
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:45,990
No!

984
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:48,550
HeIp!

985
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:50,560

989
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:24,390

991
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:33,300
Charlie!

992
01:24:40,110 --> 01:24:41,540
We gotta get Charlie.

993
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:44,050
Please! What are you doing?
No, we gotta go!

994
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,610
Shut up!
Come on!

995
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,010
- Charlie's on the roof.
- Shut up.

996
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:48,810
Shut up!

997
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:33,930
Let's just take this down a notch.

998
01:25:36,330 --> 01:25:38,430
So what you're sayin' to me...

999
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:41,870
is that Rose killed your husbands,
forged breakup notes...

1000
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:43,870
to make you think
that they left you.

1001
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:47,540
Yes, yes, yes! That's them
up on the roof. Up on the roof!

1002
01:25:47,610 --> 01:25:48,840
Listen !

1003
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:52,370
Oh, you just don't get it, do you?

1004
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:56,620
We can talk about this here...

1005
01:25:56,690 --> 01:25:59,890
or we can talk about it downtown.

1006
01:26:58,350 --> 01:27:01,180
- Charlie, l'm coming up!
- Charlie, hang on!

1007
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:04,590
Charlie.

1008
01:27:16,330 --> 01:27:18,930
Charlie, be careful!

1009
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,370
Oh, God.

1010
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:52,790
Rose!

1011
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:02,910
Charlie!

1012
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:04,910
Help!

San Francisco Police.

01:28:12,090 --> 01:28:14,220
Let go of her, Charlie.
I got her.

1015
01:28:16,290 --> 01:28:20,160
Okay, Rose. Come on.
We're going in. Sorry.

1016
01:28:40,850 --> 01:28:44,550
Rose
Jailbird

1017
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:48,850
Happy in her cage
No longer full of rage

1018
01:28:48,930 --> 01:28:50,860
She roosts

1019
01:28:56,570 --> 01:29:00,730
Harriet
Sweet Harriet

1020
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:04,870
You acted cuckoo
