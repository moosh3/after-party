00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,983
- Hello?
- Hello.

3
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:26,110
- Yes?
- Who is this?

4
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:28,905
- Who you trying to reach?
- What number is this?

5
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:32,033
- What number are you trying to reach?
- I don't know.

6
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:34,327
- Well, I think you have the wrong number.
- Do I?

7
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,496
It happens. Take it easy.

8
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:46,798
Hello?

9
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:48,716
I'm sorry.
I guess I dialed the wrong number.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,470
- So why'd you dial it again?
- To apologize.

11
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:56,015
- You're forgiven. Bye now.
- Wait, wait! Don't hang up.

12
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:58,893
- What?
- I wanna talk to you for a second.

13
00:00:58,977 --> 00:01:01,437
They've got 900 numbers for that. See ya.

14
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:25,461
- Hello?
- Why don't you want to talk to me?

15
00:01:25,545 --> 00:01:29,215
- Who is this?
- You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.

16
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:31,676
I don't think so.

17
00:01:33,136 --> 00:01:35,346
- What's that noise?
- Popcorn.

18
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,931
- You're making popcorn?
- Uh-huh.

19
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:39,309
I only eat popcorn at the movies.

20
00:01:39,392 --> 00:01:42,770
- Well, I'm getting ready to watch a video.
- Really? What?

21
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:44,897
Oh, just some scary movie.

22
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:47,442
- You like scary movies?
- Uh-huh.

23
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:50,778
- What's your favorite scary movie?
- Uh, I don't know.

24
00:01:50,862 --> 00:01:53,573
You have to have a favorite.
What comes to mind?

25
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:56,200
Um, Halloween.

26
00:01:56,743 --> 00:01:58,911
You know, the one with the guy
in the white mask...

27
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:00,830
who walks around and stalks babysitters?

28
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:03,583
- Yeah.
- What's yours?

29
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:04,667
Guess.

30
00:02:05,418 --> 00:02:08,421
Um, Nightmare on Elm Street.

31
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:10,882
Is that the one where the guy
had knives for fingers?

32
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:13,676
- Yeah, Freddy Krueger.
- Freddy, that's right.

33
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,095
I liked that movie. It was scary.

34
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:18,723
Well, the first one was,
but the rest sucked.

35
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,475
So, you got a boyfriend?

36
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:24,187
Why? You wanna ask me out on a date?

37
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,399
- Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
- Mmm, no.

38
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:31,694
- You never told me your name.
- Why do you want to know my name?

39
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:33,404
'Cause I want to know who I'm looking at.

40
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,617
What did you say?

41
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:40,328
I want to know who I'm talking to.

42
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:43,289
- That's not what you said.
- What do you think I said?

43
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,418
What?

44
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:50,630
Hello?

45
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:52,924
Look, I gotta go.

46
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,926
Wait! I thought we were gonna go out.

47
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,303
Uh, no. I don't think so.

48
00:02:57,387 --> 00:02:58,888
Don't hang up on me!

49
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:09,107
Shit.

50
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:14,195
- Yes?
- I told you not to hang up on me.

51
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,280
- What do you want?
- To talk.

52
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:18,616
Well, dial someone else, okay?

53
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:29,377
Listen, asshole!

54
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,045
No, you listen, you little bitch!

55
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:34,340
You hang up on me again,
I'll gut you like a fish, understand?

56
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:38,052
Yeah.

57
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:39,971
Is this some kind of joke?

58
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:42,390
More of a game, really.

59
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,102
Can you handle that...

60
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,647
blondie?

61
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,285
Can you see me?

62
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:09,375
Listen, I am two seconds away
from calling the police.

63
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:13,880
They'd never make it in time.
We're out in the middle of nowhere.

64
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:18,885
- What do you want?
- To see what your insides look like.

65
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:30,688
Who's there? Who's there?

66
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:33,191
I'm calling the police.

67
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,112
You should never say, “Who's there?”

68
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:41,657
Don't you watch scary movies?
It's a death wish.

69
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:45,203
You might as well just come out here
to investigate a strange noise or something.

70
00:04:46,204 --> 00:04:48,998
Look, you've had your fun now...

71
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:51,542
so I think you better just leave or else.

72
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:53,211
Or else what?

73
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:57,381
Or else my boyfriend'll be here any second,
and he'll be pissed when he finds out.

74
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:59,675
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.

75
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,639
I lied! I do have a boyfriend, and he'll be
here any second, so your ass better be gone.

76
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:08,059
- Sure.
- I swear.

77
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:13,773
He's big and he plays football
and he'll kick the shit out of you!

78
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:17,235
I'm getting scared.
I'm shaking in my boots.

79
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,279
So you better just leave.

80
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:23,616
His name wouldn't be... Steve, would it?

81
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:28,162
How do you know his name?

82
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:31,833
Turn on the patio lights... again.

83
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:45,346
Oh, God!

84
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,641
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Where are you? Where are you?

85
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:49,684
Guess.

86
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,269
Please don't hurt him.

87
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:52,854
That all depends on you.

88
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:54,647
Why are you doing this?

89
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,149
- I wanna play a game.
- No.

90
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:59,735
- Then he dies right now!
- No! No!

91
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:03,865
Which is it? Which is it?

92
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:08,327
Wha— What kind of game?

93
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:12,623
Turn off the light.
You'll see what kind of game.

94
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:14,208
Just do it!

95
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:20,256
Casey! No! No!

96
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,383
No! Casey!

97
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,886
Here's how we play.

98
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:28,806
I ask a question.
If you get it right, Steve lives.

99
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,225
- Please don't do this.
- Come on. It'll be fun.

100
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:33,102
- Please.
- It's an easy category.

101
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,146
- Please.
- Movie trivia.

102
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,566
- I'll even give you a warm-up question.
- Don't do this. I can't.

103
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:41,777
- Name the killer in Halloween.
- No.

104
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:44,906
- Come on!
- It's your favorite scary movie, remember?

105
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:47,289
He had a white mask,
he stalked the babysitters.

106
00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:48,224
I don't know.

107
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:51,078
- Come on. Yes, you do.
- No, please.

108
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:53,998
- What's his name?
- I can't think.

109
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,292
Steve's counting on you.

110
00:06:57,752 --> 00:07:00,129
Michael. Michael, Michael—

111
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,798
Yes! Very good.

112
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:05,384
- Now for the real question.
- No!

113
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:08,554
- But you're doing so well.
- We can't stop now.

114
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:13,768
- Please stop! Leave us alone!
- Then answer the question. Same category.

115
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:17,146
Oh, please stop.

116
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,316
Name the killer in Friday the 13th.

117
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,902
Jason! Jason! Jason!

118
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:26,447
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.

119
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,283
No, it's not! No, it's not. It was Jason.

120
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:31,953
Afraid not. No way.

121
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:35,456
Listen, it was Jason.
I saw that movie 20 goddamn times!

122
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:39,293
Then you should know Jason's mother,
Mrs. Voorhees, was the original killer.

123
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:41,295
Jason didn't show up until the sequel.

124
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:44,256
I'm afraid that was a wrong answer.

125
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,841
You tricked me.

126
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:48,135
Lucky for you, there's a bonus round.

127
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:52,056
But poor Steve. I'm afraid he’s out!

128
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:20,584
Hey. We're not finished yet.

129
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:25,589
Final question. Are you ready?

130
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:29,343
Please. Please leave me alone.

131
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:31,262
Answer the question, and I will.

132
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:36,350
What door am I at?

133
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:37,685
What?

134
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:41,689
There are two main doors to your house—
a front door and the patio doors.

135
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:43,733
If you answer correctly, you live.

136
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:46,360
Very simple.

137
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:48,946
Don't do this. I can't. I won't.

138
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,157
Your call.

139
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,594
Did you water over here today?

140
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:20,139
- It was just that water from the rain.
- They look great, don't they?

141
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:23,225
- Don't they smell strong?
- I told you. You could send it back.

142
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:27,730
Mom!

143
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:31,108
- Jesus!
- What is it?

144
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:45,956
Casey.

145
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:51,212
Oh. Oh, G—

146
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:57,092
Casey? Casey?

147
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:58,802
Casey!

148
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:03,307
- Where is she?
- Call the police.

149
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:10,064
Casey!

150
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:13,192
- Casey, you upstairs?
- Oh, my God. Casey, baby?

151
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:15,736
- Where is she?
- She's here.

152
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,571
- Mama.
- Oh, my God, I can hear her.

153
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:20,908
- Mom.
- Where is she?

154
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:24,787
Oh, my God! I can hear her.

155
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:26,789
Hey!

156
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,546
Get in the car.
Drive down to the MacKenzies'.

157
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,258
- No. No, not my daughter.
- Just go.

158
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:38,926
- Not my daughter.
- Call the police.

159
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:25,472
- It's just me.
- Billy, what are you doing here?

160
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:27,433
- Sorry. Don't hate me.
- Oh, my God.

161
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:29,601
- You sleep in that?
- Yes, I sleep in this.

162
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:31,812
My dad is in the other room.
You can't be in here.

163
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,480
- I'll just stay a sec.
- No. You can't be—

164
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:34,815
Oh, no.

165
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,358
You gotta go. Go, go, go.

166
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:37,943
What's going on in there?

167
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,571
- Are you okay?
- Can you knock?

168
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,489
- I heard screaming.
- No, you didn't.

169
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:43,615
No?

170
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:48,078
Oh, well. I'm hitting the sack.

171
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:50,581
My flight leaves first thing in the morning.

172
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:53,751
Now, the expo runs all weekend,
so I won't be back till Sunday.

173
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:56,587
- There's cash on the table, I'm staying at—
- The Hilton.

174
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,423
- Out at the airport, so call if—
- If I need anything. Yeah, I got it.

175
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,425
I could have sworn I heard screaming.

176
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,512
Have a good trip, okay?

177
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:07,097
Sleep tight, sweetie.

178
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:13,812
Oh! Close call.

179
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:14,980
Billy—

180
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:16,690
What are you doing here?

181
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:19,109
It occurred to me that...

182
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:21,028
I've never snuck through
your bedroom window.

183
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,697
Great. And now that
it's out of your system—

184
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:28,035
I was home watching television.
The, uh— The Exorcist was on.

185
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,620
Got me thinking of you.

186
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:32,164
It did?

187
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:33,707
Yeah.

188
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,085
It was edited for TV—
all the good stuff was cut out—

189
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:41,048
and it got me thinking of us.

190
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:44,134
How two years ago
we started off hot and heavy—

191
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:48,138
nice solid R-rating
on our way to an NC-17.

192
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:53,102
And how things have changed and...

193
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:01,151
lately we're just sort of
edited for television.

194
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:06,198
So, you thought
you would climb in my window...

195
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,367
and we'd have a little raw footage?

196
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,662
No. No, I wouldn't dream
of breaking your underwear rule.

197
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:18,502
I just— I thought maybe we could do
a little on-top-of-the-clothes stuff.

198
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,006
Okay.

199
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:26,218
Yeah?

200
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,302
Yeah.

201
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:42,693
- Hi.
- Hey.

202
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,211
Okay. Okay, okay. Time is up, stud-bucket.

203
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:04,173
God, you see what you do to me?

204
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,801
You know what my dad will do to you?

205
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,471
Yeah.

206
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:13,265
- Well, I'm going.
- Okay.

207
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:25,486
You know, I appreciate
the romantic gesture.

208
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:30,866
Hey. About the sex stuff—

209
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:34,161
I'm not trying to rush you at all.

210
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:35,746
I was only half serious.

211
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:38,999
Okay.

212
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:48,759
Hey, Billy.

213
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:53,096
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?

214
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:54,932
What's that?

215
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:04,650
My God. You're just a tease.

216
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,002
There's blood found? All right.

217
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,229
...are doing drugs,
that they are high in the classrooms...

218
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:44,439
and that they are involved in the occult.

219
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:45,857
Occult?

220
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:50,654
The small town of Woodsboro, California,
was devastated last night...

221
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,240
when two young teenagers
were found brutally murdered.

222
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,534
Authorities have yet to issue a statement...

223
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:57,828
but our sources tell us
that no arrest has been made...

224
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,413
and the murderer could strike again.

225
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:01,206
- Do you believe this shit?
- Tatum!

226
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,250
- What is going on?
- You don't know?

227
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,543
No.

228
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:07,421
Casey Becker and Steve Orth
were killed last night.

229
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,089
What? No way!

230
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:12,175
And we're not just talking killed.
We're talking splatter-movie killed.

231
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,177
Ripped open from end to end.

232
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,763
Casey Becker.
She sits next to me in English.

233
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:18,140
Not anymore.

234
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:21,268
It's so sad. Her mom and dad,
they found her hanging from a tree...

235
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:22,811
her insides on the outside.

236
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,771
Oh, my God!

237
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:27,482
- Do they know who did it?
- Fucking clueless.

238
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:30,694
I mean, they're interrogating the entire
school— teachers, students, janitors.

239
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,280
- They think it's school-related?
- They don't know.

240
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:35,949
Dewey was saying this is
the worst crime they've seen in years...

241
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:37,659
even worse than—

242
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,954
Well, it's bad.

243
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,420
- Here you go, Mrs. Tate.
- Thank you, James.

244
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,051
Sidney.

245
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:57,095
It would appear to be your turn.

246
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:03,477
- Who's up next?
- Sidney Prescott.

247
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:06,271
She was daughter of—

248
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:11,318
- Sidney. How you feelin'?
- Fine.

249
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,903
Hi, Sidney.

250
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,030
Sheriff Burke, Dewey.

251
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:17,949
That's Deputy Riley today, Sid.

252
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:22,204
- How is everything?
- Good.

253
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,373
And your dad? How's he doin'?

254
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:26,458
We're fine. Thanks.

255
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,835
We're gonna keep this very brief, Sidney.

256
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,088
The police just want to
ask you a few questions. You okay?

257
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:35,842
Sidney, were you very close
to Casey Becker?

258
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:39,596
Remember, your principal loves you,
and I want you to be safe.

259
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,225
All students are encouraged to return
to their homes promptly from school grounds.

260
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,143
Avoid strangers. Walk in twos and threes.

261
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,198
What kind of questions
did they ask you, Sidney?

262
00:19:47,223 --> 00:19:49,797
- They asked if I knew Casey.
- Yeah. They asked me that too.

263
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:53,610
- Hey, they ask if you like to hunt?
- Yeah, they did. They ask you?

264
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:56,196
Hunt? Why would they ask you
if you like to hunt?

265
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,115
'Cause their bodies were gutted.

266
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,242
Thank you, Randy.

267
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:01,993
They didn't ask me if I like to hunt.

268
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:04,162
That's 'cause there's no way
a girl could've killed 'em.

269
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:07,833
That is so sexist. The killer could easily
be female. Basic Instinct?

270
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,252
That was an ice pick.
Not exactly the same thing.

271
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,713
Yeah. Casey and Steve
were completely hollowed out.

272
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:15,716
And the fact is,
it takes a man to do something like that.

273
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,467
Or a man's mentality.

274
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:20,011
How do you... gut someone?

275
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,100
You take a knife...

276
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:28,603
and you slit 'em from groin to sternum.

277
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:32,232
Hey. It's called tact, you fuck-rag.

278
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,818
Hey, Stu, didn't you used to date Casey?

279
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:36,903
Yeah, for like two seconds.

280
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:38,447
Before she dumped him for Steve.

281
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,031
I thought you dumped her for me.

282
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,575
I did. He's full of shit.

283
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,452
And are the police aware
that you dated the victim?

284
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:46,663
Hey, what are you saying?
That I killed her?

285
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:48,707
It would certainly improve
your high school “Q.”

286
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:52,669
- Stu was with me last night, okay?
- Yeah, I was.

287
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:56,256
Was that before or after
he sliced and diced?

288
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,383
Fuck you, nutcase.
Where were you last night?

289
00:20:58,467 --> 00:20:59,926
Working, thank you.

290
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,304
At the video store?
I thought they fired your sorry ass.

291
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:03,388
Twice.

292
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:08,268
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Nobody said you did.

293
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:10,020
Thanks, buddy.

294
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:15,150
Besides, it takes a man
to do something like that.

295
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:17,444
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second, kid.

296
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:19,070
Tell me something—

297
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:21,281
Did you really put her liver in the mailbox?

298
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:24,785
'Cause I heard they found her liver in the
mailbox next to her spleen and her pancreas.

299
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:27,579
Randy, you goon-fuck.
I'm trying to eat here.

300
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:29,456
She's getting mad, all right?

301
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,082
You better liver alone.

302
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,712
Liver alone!

303
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:43,178
Ow! Liver. Liver. It was a joke.

304
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,937
- See you, Sidney.
- I'll talk to you tomorrow, Sid.

305
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:19,047
So, you sure I can stay over?
'Cause my dad won't be back till Sunday.

306
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,966
No problem.
I'll pick you up after practice.

307
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:24,594
You okay?

308
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:28,765
Uh-huh. It's just, you know,
the police and reporters and everything.

309
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:31,226
It's like déjà vu all over again.

310
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:33,645
I'll be there by 7:00. I promise.

311
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,522
- Thanks, Tatum.
- Later.

312
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:27,657
The bodies of 1 7-year-old Casey Becker
and her 18-year-old boyfriend, Steven Orth...

313
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,576
were discovered late last night
by the girl's parents—

314
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,786
The Woodsboro double murder case.

315
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:34,915
Authorities are baffled
by the lack of clues and the savage—

316
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,085
The town's in shock, and no one
can quite believe what has happened here...

317
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:40,629
although this is not the first time...

318
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:43,840
this small community of Woodsboro
has endured such tragedy.

319
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:46,384
Only a year ago,
Maureen Prescott, wife and mother...

320
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:50,847
was found raped and murdered
not far from this peaceful town square.

321
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:02,836
Hello?

322
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,754
Practice ran late. I'm on my way, okay?

323
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,092
It's past 7:00.

324
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:11,886
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it
till way after 10:00.

325
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:15,098
Oh, that's comforting.

326
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:16,808
I'm gonna swing by the video store.

327
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:19,102
I was thinkin' Tom Cruise
in All The Right Moves.

328
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,813
You know, if you pause it just right,
you can see his penis.

329
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:23,815
Whatever. Just hurry, okay?

330
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:25,108
Ta-ta, Sid.

331
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:37,328
Tatum, just get in the car—

332
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:39,164
Hello, Sidney.

333
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,210
Hi. Who is this?

334
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:45,795
You tell me.

335
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:50,467
Well, I have no idea.

336
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,135
Scary night, isn't it?

337
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:57,015
With the murders and all, it's like
right out of a horror movie or something.

338
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,476
Randy, you gave yourself away.

339
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:02,270
Are you calling from work,
'cause Tatum's on her way over.

340
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:05,565
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?

341
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:08,401
I like that thing you're doing
with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.

342
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:11,613
What's your favorite scary movie?

343
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:13,448
Oh, come on.
You know I don't watch that shit.

344
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:15,617
Why not? Too scared?

345
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,453
No. No. It's just, what's the point?
They're all the same.

346
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:21,331
Some stupid killer stalking
some big-breasted girl who can't act...

347
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,958
who's always running up the stairs
when she should be going out the front door.

348
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,543
It's insulting.

349
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:28,421
Are you alone in the house?

350
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:31,382
Randy, that's so unoriginal.
I'm disappointed in you.

351
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:34,719
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.

352
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:43,853
So who are you?

353
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:49,359
The question isn't “Who am I?”
The question is “Where am I?”

354
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,446
So, where are you?

355
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,365
Your front porch.

356
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:02,247
Why would you be calling
from my front porch?

357
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,249
That's the original part.

358
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:08,044
Oh, yeah?

359
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:13,550
Well, I call your bluff.

360
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:29,399
- So where are you?
- Right here.

361
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:04,267
- Can you see me right now?
- Uh-huh.

362
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,852
Uh-huh. Okay.

363
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:08,605
What am I doin'? Huh?

364
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:12,692
Huh? What am I doin'? Hello!

365
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:16,070
Nice try, Randy.

366
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:18,448
Tell Tatum to hurry up, okay? Bye now.

367
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:21,159
If you hang up on me,
you'll die just like your mother!

368
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:27,832
Do you wanna die, Sidney?
Your mother sure didn't.

369
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,127
Fuck you, you cretin!

370
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:44,307
No!

371
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:02,158
No!

372
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,189
Shit!

373
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:50,915
Billy! God!

374
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:53,167
Door's locked.
I heard screaming. You all right?

375
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:54,752
The killer's here. He's in the house.

376
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:58,131
He's in the house. He's gonna kill me.
He's gonna kill me.

377
00:29:58,214 --> 00:30:01,259
He's gone. He's gone.

378
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:02,844
It's all right.

379
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,731
What?

380
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,361
Sid, what?

381
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:24,824
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, Sidney, wait!

382
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:27,285
Wait, wait, wait, wait! What's going on?

383
00:30:27,368 --> 00:30:30,747
Sidney, come back! Sidney!

384
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:37,587
Sorry! I found this.

385
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:39,756
Come on!

386
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,174
All right. Hold your hands together.

387
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:43,676
Do you wish to give up
your right to remain silent?

388
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,844
I didn't do anything.

389
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:47,388
Do you wish to give up your right
to speak to an attorney...

390
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:48,973
and have them present during questioning?

391
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:51,601
Ask her. She'll tell you. Ask her.

392
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:53,853
- What do you got, Dewey?
- I caught him, Sheriff.

393
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:55,063
- Wait!
- Who is that?

394
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:56,647
- Billy Loomis.
- Sheriff.

395
00:30:56,731 --> 00:30:59,025
Sheriff, call these guys off.
I didn't do it.

396
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:02,862
Sheriff, wait. Wait, listen.

397
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:05,031
Call my dad. Please, call him.

398
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:06,574
He'll tell you. Just call him.

399
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:09,702
Sidney! Sidney!

400
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:12,288
- How's she doing?
- Sid's tougher than she looks.

401
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:14,499
Have to be,
all the shit she's been through.

402
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:16,167
Sid!

403
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:19,545
Well, we're seein' a lot of you today.

404
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:22,507
You gonna be able to come down to the station
and answer a few questions, Sid?

405
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,050
Oh, shit. Sidney!

406
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:26,302
God, Sid. I'm so sorry I was late.
Are you all right?

407
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:28,304
Tatum, you can't be here.
This is an official crime scene.

408
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:29,847
It's okay.

409
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:32,392
Her dad's out of town, all right?
She's staying with us tonight.

410
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:35,436
- Does Mom know?
- Yes, doofus.

411
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,897
- Let's get you out of here.
- She'll be okay.

412
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,107
- Thanks.
- Come on, Sid.

413
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,691
You won't believe this.

414
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:46,322
- Right there.
- Creepy, huh?

415
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:56,249
- Break this up.
- I'll be damned.

416
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:57,834
- What?
- Jesus! The camera, hurry!

417
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:00,044
My name isn't Jesus.

418
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,840
Sidney, is that you in there?

419
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,883
- Excuse me.
- Is that Sidney Prescott they took away?

420
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:07,802
- I'm not talking to you.
- What happened to her?

421
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:09,387
None of your damn business.

422
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,264
I heard something about a costume.
Is that true?

423
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:13,641
Can you tell me anything?

424
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:17,019
Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass.
Leave Sid alone.

425
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:19,772
Where's she goin'?

426
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:23,776
- Look. Kenny?
- Yeah?

427
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,446
I know that you're about
50 pounds overweight...

428
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:28,072
but when I say “hurry”...

429
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:33,202
please interpret that as
“move your fat, tub-of-lard ass now!”

430
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:38,082
Did you find him?

431
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,585
You sure it was the Hilton?

432
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:42,712
At the airport.

433
00:32:44,297 --> 00:32:45,673
He's not registered there.

434
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,135
Could he have stayed somewhere else?

435
00:32:50,261 --> 00:32:52,388
I don't know. I guess.

436
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,101
Don't worry, Sid. We'll find him.

437
00:32:57,185 --> 00:32:59,061
Dewey, they got that mask in.

438
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:03,191
I'll be right back.

439
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:12,116
Let me ask you this.

440
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,410
What are you doing
with a cellular telephone, son?

441
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:17,205
Everybody's got one, Sheriff.

442
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:20,082
I didn't make those calls, I swear.

443
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,001
Why don't you check the phone bill,
for Christ's sake?

444
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:24,587
Call Vital Phone Comp.
They got the records of every number dialed.

445
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,756
Thanks, Hank. We're on top of it.

446
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:30,301
What were you doing over
at Sidney's house tonight?

447
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:32,887
I wanted to see her. That's all.

448
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:36,724
And last night? Sidney said you crawled
through her window last night too.

449
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:38,392
You went out last night?

450
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:43,773
I was watching TV.
I got bored. I decided to go for a ride.

451
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,650
Did you happen to ride by
Casey Becker's house?

452
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:48,528
No. No, I didn't.

453
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:50,780
Sheriff, I didn't kill anybody...

454
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:59,247
We're gonna have to hold you, son,
till we get those phone records.

455
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,085
This is crazy.

456
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:08,089
You know that? I didn't do it.

457
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,686
Camera Two? Okay.

458
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:23,312
Are there any more doughnuts in there?

459
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:26,482
- Move it, Kenny.
- They're not lettin' anybody in.

460
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:28,067
I'm not just anyone.

461
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,610
More like a bitch goddess.

462
00:34:29,694 --> 00:34:31,362
- Kenny, are we on?
- Yeah, go.

463
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:34,073
Hi. Gale Weathers reporting live
from the Woodsboro police station...

464
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:36,450
where we hope to get a glimpse
of Sidney Prescott.

465
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:38,035
Hey. Watch it, lady.

466
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,246
Hey, watch the hand!
You know who you're dealing with here?

467
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:43,291
Tell 'em. Come on, Dad. Tell 'em!

468
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:45,626
- Just wait for the lawyer, Billy.
- Sidney!

469
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,045
- Sidney, come on. You know me.
- Come on, come on.

470
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:50,798
- Sidney, look at me!
- Don't give us any trouble.

471
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:52,008
Come on!

472
00:34:57,597 --> 00:34:58,889
Sid.

473
00:34:58,973 --> 00:35:01,475
We're gonna get you
out of here, okay? You okay?

474
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:06,397
They sell this costume
at every five-and-dime in the state.

475
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:08,899
There's no way to track the purchase.

476
00:35:10,443 --> 00:35:12,028
What about that cellular phone bill?

477
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:16,449
We're pulling Loomis's account.
We won't know anything until the morning.

478
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:18,075
Oh, come on!

479
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,453
You think he did it?

480
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:23,539
Twenty years ago,
I would've said, “Not a chance.”

481
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:25,374
But these kids today—

482
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,002
Damned if I know.

483
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:31,297
- Hey, Dewey, can we go now?
- Hold on a second.

484
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,049
Goddamn it, Dewey!

485
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:37,428
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this
badge, you treat me like a man of the law.

486
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:40,848
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy,
but we're ready to go. Now, okay?

487
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:42,391
Whoa.

488
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:45,895
Take 'em out the back way.
Avoid that circus out there.

489
00:35:47,355 --> 00:35:48,981
- Come on.
- Don't touch me!

490
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:52,943
- He's my superior!
- Janitors are your superior.

491
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:57,740
Let's get back to work!

492
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:05,706
Isn't there a back way
out of this building?

493
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,583
Yeah. Down that alley, I think.

494
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:14,173
You guys stay here. I'm gonna get the car.

495
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:15,966
Don't move. Don't make a sound.

496
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:20,262
There she is. Sidney!

497
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:24,475
Hi. Some night.
What happened? Are you all right?

498
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:26,644
She's not answering any questions,
all right? Just leave us alone.

499
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:29,438
No. No, Tatum, it's okay.
She's just doin' her job, right, Gale?

500
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:32,942
- Yes, that's right.
- So, how's the book?

501
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:34,985
Well, it'll be out later this year.

502
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:37,363
Oh. I'll look for it.

503
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:38,989
I'll send you a copy.

504
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:41,992
Jeez.

505
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:45,079
- Nice shot.
- Bitch.

506
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:48,457
- No, I mean, camera shot.
- Where'd you learn to punch like that?

507
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:51,377
God, I loved it. “I'll send you a copy.”

508
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,754
Bam! Bitch went down.

509
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:57,633
“I'll send you a copy.”
Bam! Sid, superbitch!

510
00:36:57,717 --> 00:36:59,385
You are so cool.

511
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:01,554
Thought you might
want some ice for that right hook.

512
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:03,639
Thanks.

513
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:07,476
I'll be right next door.
Try to get some sleep.

514
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,811
Yeah, yeah.

515
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:17,194
Do you really think Billy did it?

516
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:19,864
He was there, Tatum.

517
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:24,535
He was destined to have a flaw.
I knew he was too perfect.

518
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:28,456
- Telephone, honey.
- Who is it?

519
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:30,791
- It's for Sid.
- My dad?

520
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:33,711
- I don't think so.
- Take a message.

521
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:35,796
No. I'll get it.

522
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,427
How's she doin'?

523
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:46,098
Hello?

524
00:37:46,182 --> 00:37:48,225
Hello, Sidney.

525
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,269
No!

526
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,730
Poor Billy boyfriend.

527
00:37:52,813 --> 00:37:55,357
An innocent guy doesn't stand
a chance with you.

528
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:56,942
Leave me alone!

529
00:37:57,026 --> 00:38:00,196
- Looks like you fingered the
wrong guy... again!

530
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:01,280
Who are you?

531
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:02,448
- Dewey!
- Hang up, Sid.

532
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:05,659
Don't worry. You'll find out soon enough.

533
00:38:05,743 --> 00:38:07,453
- I promise.
- Dewey!

534
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:11,248
What?

535
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:15,878
- “What?”
- What?

536
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,219
Hello?

537
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:37,858
Sidney Prescott, who escaped
a vicious attack last night...

538
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:41,403
is the daughter of Maureen Prescott,
who was brutally killed last year...

539
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:44,406
when convicted murderer
Cotton Weary broke into their home...

540
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,451
and savagely raped
and tortured the deceased.

541
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:50,871
Cotton Weary is currently awaiting appeal
for the death sentence handed down...

542
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:53,707
after the young Sidney
testified against him.

543
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:56,377
She was the key witness
in the state's case against the—

544
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,257
It's never gonna stop, is it?

545
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,051
Billy was released.

546
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:08,639
His cellular bill was clean.
He didn't make those calls.

547
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:11,851
We're checkin'
every cellular account in the county.

548
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:15,062
Any calls made to you or Casey Becker
are being cross-referenced.

549
00:39:16,397 --> 00:39:18,440
It's gonna take some time,
but we'll find him.

550
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:21,360
You okay?

551
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:41,005
Don't worry, Sid.
It's school. You'll be safe here.

552
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:42,882
So how does it feel
to be almost brutally butchered?

553
00:39:42,965 --> 00:39:44,466
Hey, now leave her alone.

554
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,385
People want to know!
They have a right to know!

555
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:48,178
- Leave her alone.
- How does it feel?

556
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:50,973
She just wants to get an education.
Turn that thing off.

557
00:39:52,975 --> 00:39:53,976
What?

558
00:39:55,895 --> 00:39:56,979
Just a sec.

559
00:40:08,032 --> 00:40:09,533
Stop right there.

560
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:11,911
I'm not here to fight.
I just need to talk.

561
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:13,787
Kenny, camera, now!

562
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:15,623
- Off the record. No cameras.
- Forget it.

563
00:40:15,706 --> 00:40:17,750
Please? You owe me.

564
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:20,336
- I owe you shit.
- You owe my mother!

565
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:26,091
Your mother's murder
was last year's hottest court case.

566
00:40:26,175 --> 00:40:27,676
Somebody was gonna write a book about it.

567
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,179
Right, and it had to be you
with all your lies and bullshit theories.

568
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:33,015
What is your problem?
You got what you wanted.

569
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:35,768
Cotton Weary's in jail.
They're gonna gas him.

570
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:37,353
A book is not gonna change that.

571
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:42,608
Do you still think he's innocent?

572
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:45,486
Your testimony put him away.
It doesn't really matter what I think.

573
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:49,531
During the trial, you did all those stories
about me. You called me a liar.

574
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:51,825
I think you falsely identified him, yes.

575
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:55,371
- Have you talked to Cotton?
- Many times.

576
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:57,414
And has his story changed?

577
00:40:57,498 --> 00:40:59,291
Not one word.

578
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:02,086
He admits to having sex
with your mother, but that's all.

579
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:04,588
He's lying.
She never would have touched him.

580
00:41:04,672 --> 00:41:08,258
He raped her,
and then... he butchered her.

581
00:41:08,342 --> 00:41:09,802
Her blood was all over his coat.

582
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:11,804
He was drunk that night.

583
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:14,598
He left his coat at your house
after your mother seduced him.

584
00:41:14,682 --> 00:41:16,266
I saw him leave wearing it.

585
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,894
No, you saw someone leave
wearing that coat.

586
00:41:19,812 --> 00:41:23,148
The same someone who planted it
in Cotton's car, framing him.

587
00:41:25,734 --> 00:41:28,946
No. Cotton murdered my mother.

588
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,534
You're not so sure anymore, are you?

589
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:37,162
Nice welt, sweetie.

590
00:41:37,246 --> 00:41:38,872
Let's go, Sid.

591
00:41:38,956 --> 00:41:41,792
- The killer's still on the loose, isn't he?
- Come on, Sid.

592
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,377
Those murders are related.

593
00:41:44,712 --> 00:41:47,464
- I'm sorry I mangled your face.
- Wait. Sidney, don't go!

594
00:41:47,548 --> 00:41:49,425
Just stop, all right?

595
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:56,849
Jesus Christ!

596
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:59,685
An innocent man on death row,
a killer still on the loose.

597
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:01,103
Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.

598
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:02,938
- You wanna go live?
- No, no. Not so fast.

599
00:42:03,022 --> 00:42:04,690
We don't have anything concrete.

600
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:06,275
This is huge. You can't just sit on it.

601
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:09,069
I know! That's why we need proof.

602
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:12,489
If I'm right about this,
I could save a man's life.

603
00:42:13,657 --> 00:42:16,118
Do you know what that could do
for my book sales?

604
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,621
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.

605
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:22,875
I want you to meet me
right here after class, okay, Sid?

606
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:25,461
All right.

607
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:27,337
Hey, hey.

608
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:30,591
I haven't seen Billy around.
Is he really pissed?

609
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:34,219
You mean after you branded him
the Candyman? No, his heart's broken.

610
00:42:34,303 --> 00:42:35,304
- Ow!
- Stu!

611
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,482
Why are they doing this?

612
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:50,152
Are you kidding me?
Look at this place. It's like Christmas.

613
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:52,905
- Stupidity leak.
- Ow. Easy.

614
00:42:52,988 --> 00:42:54,156
Sidney!

615
00:42:55,741 --> 00:42:57,493
- Oh! Ow!
- Jesus! Shit!

616
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,661
It's just me.

617
00:43:01,205 --> 00:43:04,291
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You still think it's me.

618
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:07,795
No. No, I don't. It's just—

619
00:43:08,462 --> 00:43:10,589
Somebody was there.

620
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:13,092
- Billy, someone tried to kill me.
- I know, I know.

621
00:43:13,175 --> 00:43:14,802
The cops said I scared him away.

622
00:43:14,885 --> 00:43:16,386
It wasn't me, Sid.

623
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:20,849
I know. He called me again
last night at Tatum's house.

624
00:43:20,933 --> 00:43:22,559
You see? Couldn't have been me.

625
00:43:22,643 --> 00:43:24,812
I was in jail. Remember?

626
00:43:27,815 --> 00:43:30,651
I'm so... sorry. Please understand.

627
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,112
Understand what?

628
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:36,782
That I have a girlfriend who would rather
accuse me of being a psychopathic killer...

629
00:43:36,865 --> 00:43:37,991
than touch me?

630
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:42,287
- You know that's not true.
- Then what is it?

631
00:43:42,371 --> 00:43:44,456
What... is it?

632
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,875
Billy, I was attacked
and nearly filleted last night!

633
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:48,460
I mean between us.

634
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:50,712
You haven't been the same since—

635
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:54,800
since your mother died.

636
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:58,595
Is your brain leaking? My mom was killed.
I can't believe you're bringing this up!

637
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:02,391
- I know. It's been a year.
- Tomorrow! One year tomorrow.

638
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:04,143
I know. I think it's time you got over that.

639
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:08,272
I mean, when my mom left my dad,
I accepted it. It's the way it is.

640
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:10,232
She's not comin' back.

641
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:13,485
- Your parents split up.
- This is not the same thing.

642
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:15,821
Your mom left town.
She's not lying in a coffin somewhere.

643
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:17,406
Okay, okay, okay. I'm sorry.

644
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:19,575
It's a bad analogy.

645
00:44:20,409 --> 00:44:21,910
But it's just that...

646
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:24,955
I want my girlfriend back.

647
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:29,168
- Sid!
- Billy.

648
00:44:29,251 --> 00:44:31,128
I am sorry if my traumatized life...

649
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:34,131
is an inconvenience to you
and your perfect existence.

650
00:44:34,214 --> 00:44:37,426
What? What— Nobody said that. Sid!

651
00:44:39,595 --> 00:44:41,096
Stupid!

652
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,515
You make me so sick!

653
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:48,353
Your entire havoc-inducing, thieving,
whoring generation disgusts me!

654
00:44:48,896 --> 00:44:54,651
So, two of your fellow students
just savagely murdered...

655
00:44:54,735 --> 00:44:57,446
and this is the way you show
your compassion and sensitivity, huh?

656
00:44:57,529 --> 00:44:59,823
Let me tell you something.

657
00:44:59,907 --> 00:45:01,408
You're both expelled! Get out!

658
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,452
Come on, Mr. Himbry!

659
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:05,454
- It was just a joke!
- That's not fair!

660
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:12,544
You're absolutely right. It is not fair.

661
00:45:12,628 --> 00:45:15,964
Fairness would be to rip your insides out,
hang you from a tree...

662
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:20,260
so we can expose you for the heartless,
desensitized little shits that you are.

663
00:45:32,648 --> 00:45:35,275
She was never attacked.
I think she made it all up.

664
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,569
- Why would she lie about it?
- For attention!

665
00:45:37,653 --> 00:45:39,947
The girl has some serious issues.

666
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:48,205
And what if she did it?

667
00:45:48,288 --> 00:45:50,499
What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?

668
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:52,417
And why would she do that?

669
00:45:52,501 --> 00:45:55,921
Maybe she had the hots for Steve
and killed them both in a jealous rage.

670
00:45:56,004 --> 00:46:00,759
What would Sidney want with Steve?
She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend, Billy.

671
00:46:01,677 --> 00:46:04,346
Maybe she's a slut, just like her mother.

672
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:05,931
You're evil.

673
00:46:06,014 --> 00:46:09,434
Please. it's a common fact.
Her mother was a tramp.

674
00:46:09,518 --> 00:46:11,645
Cut some slack.
She watched her mom get butchered.

675
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:14,022
And it fucked her up royally.
Think about it.

676
00:46:14,106 --> 00:46:18,777
Her mother's death leaves her disturbed
and hostile in a cruel and inhumane world.

677
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:23,282
She's delusional. “Where's God?”
Et cetera. Completely suicidal.

678
00:46:23,365 --> 00:46:26,118
One day she snaps.
She wants to kill herself...

679
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:29,621
but she realizes that teen suicide
is out this year...

680
00:46:29,705 --> 00:46:33,709
and homicide is a much healthier
therapeutic expression.

681
00:46:33,792 --> 00:46:36,712
- Where do you get this shit?
- Ricki Lake.

682
00:46:36,795 --> 00:46:39,256
You are pathetic!

683
00:46:53,228 --> 00:46:54,229
Pathetic.

684
00:47:22,758 --> 00:47:24,593
Sidney.

685
00:47:29,598 --> 00:47:31,099
Is someone there?

686
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:12,974
In what appears to be a prank...

687
00:48:13,058 --> 00:48:15,560
several students were seen
wearing scary masks.

688
00:48:15,644 --> 00:48:17,437
School officials have yet to comment...

689
00:48:17,521 --> 00:48:21,733
but this is known to be
the same costume worn by the killer.

690
00:48:21,817 --> 00:48:24,945
Seventeen-year-old Casey Becker
and her boyfriend, Steven Orth...

691
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:26,530
have already lost their lives.

692
00:48:26,613 --> 00:48:31,701
Who's next? You can literally
feel the fear on this campus.

693
00:48:31,785 --> 00:48:35,080
Hi! Gale Weathers,
field correspondent, Top Story.

694
00:48:35,163 --> 00:48:38,333
I know who you are, Miss Weathers.
How's the eye?

695
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:41,086
It's productive.
Is there a problem on campus?

696
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:43,296
No, everything's under control.

697
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,257
Well, of course. You're here.

698
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,800
You're not supposed to be here.

699
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:50,762
I know. I should be in New York covering
the Sharon Stone stalker, but who knew?

700
00:48:52,347 --> 00:48:54,516
You look awfully young
to be a police officer.

701
00:48:55,684 --> 00:48:57,144
I'm 25 years old.

702
00:48:57,227 --> 00:48:58,728
You know, in a demographic study...

703
00:48:58,812 --> 00:49:02,190
I proved to be most popular
amongst males 1 1 to 24.

704
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:04,734
Guess I just missed you.

705
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:07,154
Course, you don't look a day over 12.

706
00:49:07,237 --> 00:49:09,948
Except in that upper torso area.

707
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:11,616
Does the force require you to work out?

708
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,118
No, ma'am.

709
00:49:13,702 --> 00:49:15,162
'Cause of my boyish good looks...

710
00:49:15,245 --> 00:49:18,874
muscle mass has increased my acceptance
as a serious police officer.

711
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:21,543
I need your attention now, kids.

712
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:23,670
Due to the recent events
that have occurred...

713
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:27,757
effective immediately, all classes
are suspended until further notice.

714
00:49:29,217 --> 00:49:32,429
The Woodsboro police department
has issued a citywide curfew...

715
00:49:32,512 --> 00:49:35,724
beginning at 9:00 tonight.

716
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:38,185
Looks like we've got
a serial killer on our hands.

717
00:49:38,268 --> 00:49:40,562
Serial killer's not really accurate.

718
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:43,148
Gotta knock off a couple more
to get that title.

719
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:45,275
Well, we can hope, can't we?

720
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:48,570
I mean, we certainly don't have any leads.

721
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:51,031
Have you located Sidney's father yet?

722
00:49:51,114 --> 00:49:52,616
No, not yet.

723
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:54,284
He's not a suspect, is he?

724
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:56,912
We haven't ruled him out
as a... possibility.

725
00:49:57,496 --> 00:49:58,997
If you'll excuse me.

726
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,707
I'm sorry. Am I keeping you?

727
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:03,752
If I may say so, Miss Weathers...

728
00:50:05,795 --> 00:50:07,756
you are much prettier in person.

729
00:50:09,591 --> 00:50:11,259
So you do watch the show.

730
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:17,057
I'm 25. I was 24 for a whole year.

731
00:50:18,642 --> 00:50:20,227
Please, call me Gale.

732
00:50:21,478 --> 00:50:23,897
It was just some sick fuck
having a laugh, Sidney.

733
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,191
No. It was him, Tatum. I know it.

734
00:50:26,274 --> 00:50:30,362
Well, you're not to be alone anymore, right?
If you pee, I pee. Is that clear?

735
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:32,656
Cizzool cuz scizzool is izzout.

736
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:34,115
I don't know what you did, Sidney...

737
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:37,244
But on behalf of the entire student body
we all say, “Thank you!”

738
00:50:37,327 --> 00:50:38,370
Drop it, Stu.

739
00:50:38,453 --> 00:50:42,415
I say, impromptu party tonight, my house.

740
00:50:42,499 --> 00:50:44,376
Celebrate this little siesta.
What do you say?

741
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:46,127
Are you serious?

742
00:50:47,587 --> 00:50:51,049
If this little vixen doesn't invite
the entire world, we'll be fine.

743
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:53,385
Intimate gathering, intimate friends.

744
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:57,180
What do you say, Sid?
I mean, pathos could have its perks.

745
00:50:57,264 --> 00:50:59,391
Totally protect you. Yo, I am so buff.

746
00:50:59,474 --> 00:51:01,309
- I got you covered, girl.
- I don't know.

747
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:06,231
I mean, come on, Sid.
For me? It could be fun.

748
00:51:07,399 --> 00:51:08,900
Okay. Whatever.

749
00:51:08,984 --> 00:51:10,652
Yeah? Nice.

750
00:51:11,194 --> 00:51:12,988
Cool. You guys bring food, all right?

751
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:32,299
Yes?

752
00:51:33,383 --> 00:51:34,509
Hello?

753
00:51:50,692 --> 00:51:51,693
Damn it.

754
00:52:09,586 --> 00:52:11,087
Damn little shits.

755
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:13,715
What'd you call me? Huh?

756
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:15,675
- Not you, Fred.
- You little prick.

757
00:53:28,998 --> 00:53:31,084
What if Cotton Weary is telling the truth?

758
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:34,671
Maybe he was having an affair
with your mom.

759
00:53:34,754 --> 00:53:37,382
I mean, your dad was always
out of town on business. Maybe—

760
00:53:39,676 --> 00:53:41,970
Maybe your mom was just
a very unhappy woman.

761
00:53:42,053 --> 00:53:46,099
If they were having an affair,
how come Cotton couldn't prove it in court?

762
00:53:47,267 --> 00:53:50,937
Well, you can't prove a rumor.
That's why it's a rumor.

763
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:55,108
Right. Created by
that little tabloid twit, Gale Weathers.

764
00:53:56,609 --> 00:53:58,486
It goes further back, Sid.

765
00:54:00,405 --> 00:54:01,990
There's been talk about other men.

766
00:54:02,615 --> 00:54:04,117
And you believe it.

767
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:06,286
Well—

768
00:54:07,579 --> 00:54:10,457
I mean, you can only hear that Richard
Gere gerbil story so many times...

769
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,292
before you have to start believing it.

770
00:54:17,797 --> 00:54:20,008
Oh, I'm sorry.

771
00:54:22,802 --> 00:54:24,721
You know, if I was wrong
about Cotton Weary...

772
00:54:24,804 --> 00:54:27,098
then the killer's still out there.

773
00:54:27,182 --> 00:54:28,683
Don't go there, Sid.

774
00:54:28,767 --> 00:54:31,603
You're starting to sound like
some Wes Carpenter flick or something.

775
00:54:31,686 --> 00:54:34,355
Don't freak yourself out, okay?
We've got a long night ahead of us.

776
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:36,357
Okay?

777
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:38,985
Let's boogie.

778
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:45,825
- It's alive!
- Henry, in the name of God.

779
00:54:45,909 --> 00:54:48,703
In the name of God! Now I know—

780
00:54:52,749 --> 00:54:54,542
- Watch it, jerk.
- I'm sorry.

781
00:54:59,214 --> 00:55:00,215
Dork.

782
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:03,718
Jesus, this place is packed tonight, man.

783
00:55:04,511 --> 00:55:06,304
We had a run in the mass murder section.

784
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:09,808
- Comin' to my fiesta?
- Yeah, I'm off early. Curfew, you know.

785
00:55:09,891 --> 00:55:10,850
Cool.

786
00:55:10,934 --> 00:55:13,311
What's that werewolf movie
with E.T.'s mom in it?

787
00:55:13,394 --> 00:55:16,439
- The Howling. Horror. Straight ahead.
- Okay, thanks.

788
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:21,694
- Oh, now that's in poor taste.
- What?

789
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:25,490
If you were the only suspect
in a senseless bloodbath...

790
00:55:25,573 --> 00:55:27,242
would you be standing in the horror section?

791
00:55:28,368 --> 00:55:32,622
What? It was just a misunderstanding.
He didn't do anything.

792
00:55:32,705 --> 00:55:34,666
You're such a little lapdog.

793
00:55:34,749 --> 00:55:36,835
He's got “killer” printed
all over his forehead.

794
00:55:36,918 --> 00:55:39,671
Okay! Really?

795
00:55:39,754 --> 00:55:41,923
Why'd the cops let him go, smart guy?

796
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:44,175
Because obviously
they don't watch enough movies.

797
00:55:44,259 --> 00:55:46,094
This is standard horror movie stuff.

798
00:55:46,177 --> 00:55:47,720
Prom Night revisited, man.

799
00:55:47,804 --> 00:55:50,807
Yeah? Why would he want to
kill his own girlfriend?

800
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:53,935
There's always some stupid, bullshit
reason to kill your girlfriend.

801
00:55:54,894 --> 00:55:57,355
That's the beauty of it all: simplicity.

802
00:55:57,856 --> 00:56:01,317
Besides, if it gets too complicated,
you lose your target audience.

803
00:56:01,401 --> 00:56:03,444
Well, what's his reason?

804
00:56:04,279 --> 00:56:05,989
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.

805
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:08,992
What, is she savin' herself for you?

806
00:56:09,075 --> 00:56:13,872
Maybe. Now that Billy tried to mutilate her,
do you think Sid would go out with me?

807
00:56:19,836 --> 00:56:22,171
No, I don't at all. No.

808
00:56:22,255 --> 00:56:23,798
You know who I think it is?

809
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:27,427
Yo, I think it's her father.

810
00:56:28,386 --> 00:56:30,722
Why can't they find her pops, man?

811
00:56:30,805 --> 00:56:32,974
Because he's probably dead.

812
00:56:33,975 --> 00:56:36,603
His body will come poppin' up
in the last reel somewhere!

813
00:56:36,686 --> 00:56:39,856
Eyes gouged out,
fingers cut off, teeth knocked out!

814
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:42,984
The police are always
off-track with this shit.

815
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:45,153
If they'd watch Prom Night,
they'd save time.

816
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:49,991
There's a formula to it. A very simple
formula! Everybody's a suspect!

817
00:56:55,997 --> 00:56:57,999
I'm telling you.
The dad's a red herring. It's Billy.

818
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:03,296
How do we know you're not the killer? Huh?

819
00:57:04,756 --> 00:57:05,798
Hi, Billy.

820
00:57:05,882 --> 00:57:09,218
Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost
its reality button. You ever think of that?

821
00:57:09,302 --> 00:57:11,304
You're absolutely right.
I'm the first to admit it.

822
00:57:11,387 --> 00:57:14,182
If this were a scary movie,
I'd be the prime suspect.

823
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:17,185
- That's right.
- And what would be your motive?

824
00:57:18,019 --> 00:57:20,271
It's the millennium.

825
00:57:20,355 --> 00:57:21,981
Motives are incidental.

826
00:57:22,065 --> 00:57:23,983
Millennium.

827
00:57:24,067 --> 00:57:25,610
Millennium. I like that.

828
00:57:25,693 --> 00:57:28,404
That's good. It's the millennium.

829
00:57:29,697 --> 00:57:31,199
Good kid.

830
00:57:33,034 --> 00:57:35,036
“Millennium.” Good word, my man.

831
00:57:35,787 --> 00:57:37,747
You're telling me that's not a killer.

832
00:58:22,959 --> 00:58:24,419
Sure is quiet.

833
00:58:26,004 --> 00:58:29,173
God, look at this place.
It's The Town That Dreaded Sundown.

834
00:58:29,257 --> 00:58:32,260
Yeah, I saw that movie.
It's about a killer in Texas, huh?

835
00:58:33,469 --> 00:58:37,015
Hey, if they make a movie about you,
who's gonna play you?

836
00:58:37,098 --> 00:58:38,725
I shudder to think.

837
00:58:38,808 --> 00:58:41,060
I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.

838
00:58:41,144 --> 00:58:43,604
Thanks, Dewey. With my luck,
they'd cast Tori Spelling.

839
00:58:44,772 --> 00:58:46,733
I'm just gonna be a few minutes.

840
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:49,277
You girls don't go too far.

841
00:58:52,071 --> 00:58:53,781
Is Billy gonna be there tonight?

842
00:58:53,865 --> 00:58:56,617
He'd better not be.
I told Stu to keep his mouth shut.

843
00:58:56,701 --> 00:58:59,162
I think we can live
without the endorphin rush for one night.

844
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:05,168
Billy's right, you know.
Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.

845
00:59:05,251 --> 00:59:08,838
So you have a few intimacy issues
as a result of your mother's untimely death.

846
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:11,466
That's no big deal, Sid. You'll thaw out.

847
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:14,886
Yeah, but he has been so patient with me—
you know, with all the sex stuff.

848
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:17,472
How many guys would put up with
a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?

849
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:20,975
Billy and his penis
don't deserve you, all right?

850
00:59:30,902 --> 00:59:35,073
- Dewey, where the hell you been?
- I was keepin' an eye on Sidney.

851
00:59:36,157 --> 00:59:37,617
Thought you quit.

852
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,244
I did. But damn it—

853
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:44,457
Dewey, Vital Phone just faxed us.

854
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:49,128
Those calls are listed to Neil Prescott,
Sidney's father.

855
00:59:49,629 --> 00:59:52,548
He made the calls with a cellular phone.
It's been confirmed.

856
00:59:54,092 --> 00:59:56,177
There's no way his cellular
could've been cloned?

857
00:59:56,803 --> 00:59:59,722
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is.

858
00:59:59,806 --> 01:00:02,266
The anniversary of his wife's death.

859
01:00:05,645 --> 01:00:07,939
We'll keep the roadblocks and the curfew
in effect through the night.

860
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:10,483
If he's not picked up by morning,
then we'll do a house-to-house.

861
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:14,362
Where's Sidney?

862
01:00:14,445 --> 01:00:16,697
She's with my sister.
You want me to bring her in?

863
01:00:16,781 --> 01:00:19,033
Nah. Not just yet.

864
01:00:19,826 --> 01:00:23,204
Let's find Neil first,
make sure he's our man.

865
01:00:31,963 --> 01:00:33,548
You stay close to Sidney.

866
01:00:34,215 --> 01:00:35,716
Don't let her out of your sight.

867
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,051
Yes, sir.

868
01:01:13,379 --> 01:01:15,047
All right. You girls have fun.

869
01:01:15,715 --> 01:01:17,592
Not too much fun, or I'll bust you.

870
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,304
- Bye.
- Bye, Sid.

871
01:01:34,901 --> 01:01:36,235
Caterer's here.

872
01:01:39,405 --> 01:01:40,865
That's mature.

873
01:01:40,948 --> 01:01:43,618
You guys were tardy for the party,
so we started without you.

874
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:45,203
My man!

875
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:06,098
Were we spotted?

876
01:02:06,182 --> 01:02:08,017
I don't think so. Now get the camera.

877
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:13,189
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

878
01:02:13,272 --> 01:02:15,191
Deputy, that's okay.

879
01:02:15,274 --> 01:02:16,776
What brings you to these parts?

880
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,988
Well, you just never know
when or where a story will break.

881
01:02:21,864 --> 01:02:25,117
Not much of a story here.
Just a bunch of kids cuttin' it loose.

882
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:27,870
Then what are you doing here?

883
01:02:30,665 --> 01:02:32,625
Just keepin' an eye on things.

884
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:34,210
I'm gonna check the party out.

885
01:02:35,836 --> 01:02:37,338
Do you mind if I join you?

886
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,382
Not at all.

887
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:42,593
All right. Let me just get my coat.

888
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:51,477
- All right.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

889
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:53,938
Yeah.

890
01:02:56,148 --> 01:02:58,109
How many Evil Deads?

891
01:02:58,192 --> 01:02:59,318
Yeah!

892
01:02:59,402 --> 01:03:01,904
- How many Hellraisers?
- Hellraiser right here.

893
01:03:01,988 --> 01:03:04,991
The Fog, Terror Train, Prom Night.

894
01:03:05,074 --> 01:03:07,827
How come Jamie Lee Curtis
is in all of these movies?

895
01:03:08,536 --> 01:03:11,038
She's the... scream queen.

896
01:03:11,122 --> 01:03:13,541
With a set of lungs
like that, she should be.

897
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:16,002
- Yeah.
- Tits. See?

898
01:03:17,086 --> 01:03:18,379
I'll get it.

899
01:03:20,756 --> 01:03:22,800
Hey, Tate, grab another beer, would you?

900
01:03:22,883 --> 01:03:24,343
There's beer in the garage.

901
01:03:24,427 --> 01:03:25,928
What am I, the beer wench?

902
01:03:26,012 --> 01:03:27,847
- And she was nominated.
- Oh, yeah?

903
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:29,432
She was nominated for Terror Train.

904
01:03:29,515 --> 01:03:32,143
You are not gonna believe who's here!
It's that chick from Top Story.

905
01:03:32,226 --> 01:03:34,145
- Gale Weathers?
- Here. Yeah.

906
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:35,396
Shit!

907
01:03:36,522 --> 01:03:38,649
You're underage, son.

908
01:03:38,733 --> 01:03:41,277
I'm kiddin'. Have a good time,
Watch your driving.

909
01:03:41,944 --> 01:03:43,195
- Dewey?
- Hi.

910
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:44,905
Dewey?

911
01:03:46,365 --> 01:03:49,452
- What is she doing here?
- She's with me.

912
01:03:49,535 --> 01:03:51,912
- I'm just checkin' things out.
- So you did.

913
01:03:51,996 --> 01:03:56,334
Now leave, and take
your media muff with you.

914
01:03:58,586 --> 01:04:00,629
- I just think you're awesome.
- Oh, thank you very much.

915
01:04:00,713 --> 01:04:02,631
- I watch your show religiously.
- That's great.

916
01:04:03,257 --> 01:04:05,301
- Hey.
- Hey.

917
01:04:05,384 --> 01:04:06,969
I need a camera.

918
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:11,098
- Did they find my father?
- I'm afraid not.

919
01:04:12,892 --> 01:04:15,311
- Should I be worried?
- Not yet.

920
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,442
That's the one I want— Halloween.

921
01:05:06,028 --> 01:05:07,196
Jesus!

922
01:05:10,324 --> 01:05:12,118
Tatum, it's okay.

923
01:05:22,336 --> 01:05:23,337
Shit.

924
01:05:28,634 --> 01:05:30,136
Hey, shitheads!

925
01:05:32,012 --> 01:05:33,180
Hello!

926
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:36,976
Shit. Piss.

927
01:05:55,327 --> 01:05:56,996
Is that you, Randy?

928
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:00,541
Cute.

929
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:03,002
And what movie is this from?
I Spit On Your Garage?

930
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:06,589
Lose the outfit.
If Sidney sees it, she'll flip.

931
01:06:07,882 --> 01:06:09,675
Oh, you wanna play psycho killer?

932
01:06:10,885 --> 01:06:12,553
Can I be the helpless victim?

933
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:15,139
Okay, let's see—

934
01:06:15,222 --> 01:06:17,433
No, please don't kill me, Mr. Ghost Face.

935
01:06:17,516 --> 01:06:19,226
I wanna be in the sequel!

936
01:06:21,687 --> 01:06:23,939
Cut, Casper. That's a wrap.

937
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,277
What the hell are you doing?

938
01:06:32,573 --> 01:06:33,908
Stop!

939
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:50,466
Fucker!

940
01:07:26,669 --> 01:07:27,670
No!

941
01:07:45,062 --> 01:07:47,773
- Happy curfew.
- Nice party, Stu.

942
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:51,193
- Tatum, come on!
- Nobody here but us chickens!

943
01:07:51,277 --> 01:07:53,445
- Do you know where she is?
- No, I haven't seen her.

944
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:58,742
Billy. Hey.

945
01:07:58,826 --> 01:08:01,203
Billy. What are you doin' here?

946
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:03,664
I was hoping I could talk to Sid alone.

947
01:08:04,373 --> 01:08:06,834
You know, if Tatum sees you here,
she'll draw blood.

948
01:08:06,917 --> 01:08:09,336
I'll tell you what. Why don't you guys
go up to my parents' room?

949
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:11,255
You know, you guys can talk...

950
01:08:12,256 --> 01:08:13,549
whatever.

951
01:08:14,341 --> 01:08:15,843
Subtlety, Stu. You should look it up.

952
01:08:17,886 --> 01:08:20,014
No, it's okay. We do need to talk.

953
01:08:23,225 --> 01:08:24,310
Ow.

954
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:31,650
What's Leatherface doin' here?

955
01:08:31,734 --> 01:08:34,028
Cute. He came to make up.

956
01:08:34,111 --> 01:08:37,197
There goes my chance with Sid. Damn it!

957
01:08:37,281 --> 01:08:38,282
As if.

958
01:08:38,365 --> 01:08:40,284
That's all I'm sayin'. As if.

959
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:42,911
Oh, really, Alicia?

960
01:08:44,496 --> 01:08:45,623
“As if.”

961
01:08:45,706 --> 01:08:47,166
I'm gonna go check on them.

962
01:08:47,249 --> 01:08:48,876
Come on!

963
01:08:48,959 --> 01:08:51,003
Okay, everyone.
It was nice to meet all of you.

964
01:08:51,086 --> 01:08:52,796
- Thank you.
- Stick around.

965
01:08:53,547 --> 01:08:54,840
You're a genius.

966
01:08:56,342 --> 01:08:58,135
- Oh, shit.
- What?

967
01:08:58,218 --> 01:09:01,013
- I got a delay.
- How long is it?

968
01:09:01,096 --> 01:09:04,224
I don't know. What'd it take you
to walk from the house, 30 seconds?

969
01:09:04,308 --> 01:09:06,268
- It'll be fine. Just record it.
- All right.

970
01:09:06,352 --> 01:09:08,270
The placement is perfect.

971
01:09:08,354 --> 01:09:10,022
Tell me, Kenneth—

972
01:09:10,105 --> 01:09:13,484
Has a cheesy tabloid journalist
ever won the Pulitzer?

973
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:15,152
First time for everything.

974
01:09:15,736 --> 01:09:17,404
You're damn right.

975
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:25,788
So—

976
01:09:28,332 --> 01:09:29,750
So—

977
01:09:33,253 --> 01:09:34,421
I'm sorry.

978
01:09:36,215 --> 01:09:40,177
I've been selfish, and I want to apologize.

979
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:42,846
No, Billy, I'm...

980
01:09:43,389 --> 01:09:47,017
the one who's been selfish
and self-absorbed...

981
01:09:47,101 --> 01:09:49,561
with all this post-traumatic stress.

982
01:09:50,938 --> 01:09:53,941
- You lost your mom.
- Yeah, I know, but you're right.

983
01:09:54,608 --> 01:09:55,859
Enough is enough.

984
01:09:55,943 --> 01:10:00,989
I can't wallow in
the grief process forever, and—

985
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:05,661
and I can't...

986
01:10:05,744 --> 01:10:08,539
keep lying to myself about who my mom was.

987
01:10:13,794 --> 01:10:15,462
Yeah, I think I'm really...

988
01:10:18,132 --> 01:10:19,466
scared...

989
01:10:20,426 --> 01:10:22,845
that I'm gonna turn out
just like her, you know?

990
01:10:25,097 --> 01:10:27,433
Like The Bad Seed or somethin'.

991
01:10:28,475 --> 01:10:30,728
And I know it doesn't make sense.

992
01:10:32,813 --> 01:10:34,314
Yeah, it does.

993
01:10:38,485 --> 01:10:41,905
It's like Jodie Foster in
Silence of the Lambs...

994
01:10:41,989 --> 01:10:46,034
when she keeps having
flashbacks of her dead father.

995
01:10:46,118 --> 01:10:47,786
But this is life.

996
01:10:48,412 --> 01:10:50,038
This isn't a movie.

997
01:10:50,122 --> 01:10:51,665
Sure it is, Sid.

998
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:54,752
It's all— It's all a movie.

999
01:10:54,835 --> 01:10:56,003
It's all...

1000
01:10:56,795 --> 01:10:58,672
one great big movie.

1001
01:11:05,721 --> 01:11:07,473
Only you can't pick your genre.

1002
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:36,293
Why can't I be a Meg Ryan movie?

1003
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:42,049
Or even a good porno.

1004
01:11:46,178 --> 01:11:47,137
What?

1005
01:11:47,221 --> 01:11:48,972
You heard me.

1006
01:11:57,898 --> 01:11:59,066
Are you sure?

1007
01:12:01,276 --> 01:12:02,569
Yeah.

1008
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:04,863
I think so.

1009
01:12:21,797 --> 01:12:23,298
Look, look, look. Here it comes.

1010
01:12:26,718 --> 01:12:30,305
The blood is all wrong!
Why do they do that? It's too red!

1011
01:12:30,389 --> 01:12:32,099
Wait. Here comes another.

1012
01:12:34,476 --> 01:12:36,186
Yes! Yes!

1013
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:38,355
Predictable. I knew he was gonna bite it.

1014
01:12:38,438 --> 01:12:40,941
How can you watch this shit over and over?

1015
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:43,485
When do we see breasts?
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts.

1016
01:12:43,569 --> 01:12:46,363
- When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
- Breasts?

1017
01:12:46,446 --> 01:12:48,782
Not until Trading Places in '83.

1018
01:12:48,866 --> 01:12:51,159
Jamie Lee was always the virgin
in horror movies.

1019
01:12:51,243 --> 01:12:53,996
She never showed her tits
till she went legits.

1020
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:57,040
- Could afford a decent pair.
- What'd you say?

1021
01:12:57,124 --> 01:13:00,085
That's why she always outsmarted the killer
in the big chase scene at the end.

1022
01:13:00,168 --> 01:13:02,546
Only virgins can do that.
Don't you know the rules?

1023
01:13:02,629 --> 01:13:04,464
- What rules?
- You don't—

1024
01:13:07,175 --> 01:13:09,678
Jesus Christ. You don't know the rules?

1025
01:13:09,761 --> 01:13:11,305
Have an aneurysm, why don't you?

1026
01:13:11,889 --> 01:13:14,558
There are certain rules
that one must abide by...

1027
01:13:14,641 --> 01:13:17,185
in order to successfully survive
a horror movie.

1028
01:13:17,269 --> 01:13:20,856
For instance, number one:
You can never have sex.

1029
01:13:22,983 --> 01:13:25,235
Big no-no! Big no-no!

1030
01:13:25,319 --> 01:13:27,112
I'm a dead man.

1031
01:13:27,195 --> 01:13:29,114
Sex equals death. Okay?

1032
01:13:29,197 --> 01:13:32,326
Number two:
You can never drink or do drugs.

1033
01:13:35,203 --> 01:13:37,080
No, the sin factor.

1034
01:13:37,164 --> 01:13:39,583
It's a sin.
It's an extension of number one.

1035
01:13:39,666 --> 01:13:43,337
And number three: Never, ever, ever,
under any circumstances...

1036
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,881
say “I'll be right back,”
'cause you won't be back.

1037
01:13:45,964 --> 01:13:48,717
- I'm gettin' another beer. You want one?
- Yeah, sure.

1038
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,218
I'll be right back!

1039
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:55,349
You see? You push the laws
and you end up dead.

1040
01:13:55,432 --> 01:13:57,434
Okay? I'll see you in the kitchen
with a knife.

1041
01:13:57,517 --> 01:14:00,896
Only virgins can outsmart the killer
in the big chase scene at the end.

1042
01:14:00,979 --> 01:14:03,482
- Don't you know the rules?
- What rules?

1043
01:14:03,565 --> 01:14:05,442
You don't know the rules?

1044
01:14:05,525 --> 01:14:07,194
There are certain rules
that one must abide by—

1045
01:14:08,445 --> 01:14:09,780
Boring.

1046
01:14:13,784 --> 01:14:15,285
The sheriff just radioed.

1047
01:14:15,369 --> 01:14:18,705
Somebody reported a car in the bushes
down the road. I'm gonna go check it out.

1048
01:14:18,789 --> 01:14:22,167
- Would you care to join me?
- I'd love to.

1049
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:23,919
If you're sure it's all right.

1050
01:14:24,711 --> 01:14:27,714
Ma'am, I'm the deputy of this town.

1051
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,259
Be right back.

1052
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:37,015
You see? You push the laws
and you end up dead.

1053
01:14:37,891 --> 01:14:39,768
Excuse me, ma'am.

1054
01:14:40,394 --> 01:14:42,145
I thought maybe we'd walk.

1055
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:47,067
It's such a nice night out.
I got a flashlight.

1056
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:51,697
You're not scared, are you?

1057
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:52,823
No.

1058
01:14:53,615 --> 01:14:56,243
- All right.
- Great.

1059
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:03,542
- Do you know what that constellation is?
- No. What is it?

1060
01:15:04,751 --> 01:15:06,795
I don't know. That's why I was askin' you.

1061
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:14,302
- So what happened to Tatum, Stu?
- She probably got pissed at me and bailed.

1062
01:15:14,386 --> 01:15:15,929
- Bye.
- Bye.

1063
01:15:18,432 --> 01:15:19,975
No, I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

1064
01:15:28,442 --> 01:15:29,651
Hey.

1065
01:15:36,533 --> 01:15:39,619
Look! Here comes the obligatory tit shot!

1066
01:15:43,165 --> 01:15:44,166
Yes! Whoa!

1067
01:15:44,249 --> 01:15:45,542
Lovely! Beautiful!

1068
01:15:47,252 --> 01:15:49,963
- Oh, my God.
- I'll leave you guys alone.

1069
01:15:51,256 --> 01:15:52,758
You are so...

1070
01:15:54,509 --> 01:15:55,719
amazing.

1071
01:16:02,142 --> 01:16:04,478
Hello? Yeah?

1072
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:11,401
Holy shit.

1073
01:16:15,697 --> 01:16:17,032
Listen up.

1074
01:16:17,115 --> 01:16:18,992
They found Principal Himbry dead.

1075
01:16:19,868 --> 01:16:22,996
He was gutted and hung from the goalpost
on the football field.

1076
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:24,414
So what are we waiting for?

1077
01:16:24,498 --> 01:16:26,958
Let's go over there
before they pry him down!

1078
01:16:27,459 --> 01:16:29,044
Hey.

1079
01:16:29,127 --> 01:16:30,712
- To arms! To arms!
- Hey.

1080
01:16:30,796 --> 01:16:32,422
- Where you guys—
- Where did he say he was?

1081
01:16:32,506 --> 01:16:34,591
- At the football field!
- Come on!

1082
01:16:34,674 --> 01:16:36,176
Where you guys goin'?

1083
01:16:38,386 --> 01:16:40,514
We were just gettin' to the good part.

1084
01:16:40,597 --> 01:16:43,225
Hello? Yeah?

1085
01:16:50,357 --> 01:16:51,858
Where you guys—

1086
01:17:06,998 --> 01:17:09,376
Hi-ho, Silver! Let's go!

1087
01:17:10,502 --> 01:17:13,004
So is Dewey your real name?

1088
01:17:13,088 --> 01:17:14,589
No, it's Dwight.

1089
01:17:14,673 --> 01:17:15,715
Dwight?

1090
01:17:16,383 --> 01:17:19,052
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's all right.

1091
01:17:19,136 --> 01:17:22,013
Dewey's just somethin'
I got stuck with a long time ago.

1092
01:17:23,056 --> 01:17:24,558
Well, I like it.

1093
01:17:25,976 --> 01:17:27,310
It's sexy.

1094
01:17:27,394 --> 01:17:28,895
Sexy?

1095
01:17:30,355 --> 01:17:33,650
Ah, it's just this town's way
of not takin' me serious.

1096
01:17:33,733 --> 01:17:35,402
What about Gale Weathers?

1097
01:17:36,444 --> 01:17:38,905
Sounds like I'm a meteorologist
or something.

1098
01:17:40,615 --> 01:17:44,494
People treat me like I'm the Antichrist
of television journalism.

1099
01:17:45,704 --> 01:17:47,164
I don't think you're that bad.

1100
01:17:47,247 --> 01:17:48,248
- No?
- No.

1101
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:50,876
I think that's just 'cause
you kinda like me.

1102
01:17:50,959 --> 01:17:52,919
They sure are comin' fast. Slow down!

1103
01:17:53,753 --> 01:17:55,255
Freeze! Jump!

1104
01:17:59,593 --> 01:18:01,928
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

1105
01:18:02,012 --> 01:18:03,096
Yeah.

1106
01:18:15,525 --> 01:18:17,861
I'm sorry. I'm on duty.

1107
01:18:27,037 --> 01:18:28,538
Is that what you're looking for?

1108
01:18:29,664 --> 01:18:31,166
My whole life.

1109
01:18:36,713 --> 01:18:39,049
- Damn!
- What?

1110
01:18:39,132 --> 01:18:41,051
- What is it?
- This is Neil Prescott's car.

1111
01:18:41,134 --> 01:18:42,844
- Sidney's father?
- Yeah.

1112
01:18:44,971 --> 01:18:46,556
Jesus. What's he doing here?

1113
01:18:48,433 --> 01:18:49,935
We gotta get back.

1114
01:18:54,147 --> 01:18:55,315
You okay?

1115
01:18:57,525 --> 01:18:58,652
Yeah.

1116
01:18:59,611 --> 01:19:01,071
Yeah, I'm fine.

1117
01:19:12,165 --> 01:19:13,959
Who'd you call?

1118
01:19:14,042 --> 01:19:15,669
What?

1119
01:19:15,752 --> 01:19:17,254
I don't know—

1120
01:19:17,337 --> 01:19:19,547
When you're arrested,
you're allowed one phone call.

1121
01:19:19,631 --> 01:19:21,341
So I was just curious— who'd you call?

1122
01:19:24,552 --> 01:19:26,346
Called my dad.

1123
01:19:28,556 --> 01:19:32,018
No. Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.

1124
01:19:34,938 --> 01:19:38,233
Yeah, but when I called
I didn't get an answer.

1125
01:19:49,995 --> 01:19:52,122
You don't still think it was me, do you?

1126
01:19:55,667 --> 01:19:56,876
No.

1127
01:19:58,878 --> 01:20:01,798
No. I was just thinking if it were you...

1128
01:20:01,881 --> 01:20:04,968
it'd be a very clever way
to throw me off track.

1129
01:20:05,051 --> 01:20:08,221
You know, using your one phone call
to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.

1130
01:20:08,305 --> 01:20:09,723
That's all.

1131
01:20:11,016 --> 01:20:12,058
Really?

1132
01:20:20,025 --> 01:20:24,446
What do I have to do
to prove to you that I'm not a killer?

1133
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:27,407
Oh, my God.

1134
01:20:29,701 --> 01:20:30,869
Oh, my God.

1135
01:20:31,786 --> 01:20:32,871
Billy, watch out!

1136
01:20:43,298 --> 01:20:44,299
Sid.

1137
01:21:21,795 --> 01:21:22,962
Shit!

1138
01:21:29,511 --> 01:21:32,305
Help me, somebody! Help me!

1139
01:21:50,323 --> 01:21:51,324
Help me!

1140
01:22:22,689 --> 01:22:26,526
No, Jamie. Watch out.

1141
01:22:27,735 --> 01:22:29,904
Watch out, Jamie. You know he's around.

1142
01:22:29,988 --> 01:22:31,489
You— You know—

1143
01:22:32,198 --> 01:22:35,076
Look, there he is. I told you.

1144
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:36,870
I told you he was right around the corner.

1145
01:22:38,204 --> 01:22:40,331
Jamie. Jamie.

1146
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:45,420
Jamie, look behind you. Look behind you.

1147
01:22:45,503 --> 01:22:48,089
Turn around. Behind you.

1148
01:22:48,173 --> 01:22:51,718
Oh, turn— Behind you!

1149
01:22:52,594 --> 01:22:54,971
Behind, Jamie.

1150
01:22:55,054 --> 01:22:56,514
Jamie, turn around.

1151
01:22:56,598 --> 01:22:59,100
Oh, God! Yeah.

1152
01:22:59,184 --> 01:23:01,394
Help me! Help!

1153
01:23:13,781 --> 01:23:15,408
Let me in!

1154
01:23:17,577 --> 01:23:19,287
The killer's coming after me!
He's in the house!

1155
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:20,163
Where? Wait.

1156
01:23:20,246 --> 01:23:24,250
- There's a camera in the house. Look.
- Behind you!

1157
01:23:24,334 --> 01:23:26,211
- Oh, God. No.
- Oh, shit.

1158
01:23:26,294 --> 01:23:28,463
Jamie. Jamie.

1159
01:23:28,546 --> 01:23:30,673
- Behind you, kid!
- Randy!

1160
01:23:30,757 --> 01:23:33,218
- Behind you!
- Look around!

1161
01:23:35,929 --> 01:23:37,180
- Shit.
- What?

1162
01:23:37,263 --> 01:23:40,892
- We're on 30-second delay.
- Oh, my God.

1163
01:23:48,942 --> 01:23:50,443
The... door.

1164
01:24:34,237 --> 01:24:35,905
- Is there a phone in the van?
- Yeah.

1165
01:24:37,782 --> 01:24:40,243
Lock yourself in it.
Call the sheriff for backup.

1166
01:24:42,829 --> 01:24:44,122
Be careful!

1167
01:24:57,844 --> 01:24:59,345
Neil?

1168
01:25:05,268 --> 01:25:06,769
Mr. Prescott?

1169
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:10,607
Shit!

1170
01:25:27,248 --> 01:25:28,750
Kenny, I need the cellular!

1171
01:25:33,212 --> 01:25:34,255
Kenny!

1172
01:25:36,049 --> 01:25:37,050
Kenny!

1173
01:26:02,742 --> 01:26:04,285
- 9-1-1.
- What's going on?

1174
01:26:19,092 --> 01:26:20,426
Oh, God!

1175
01:26:36,651 --> 01:26:39,946
Oh, God. Kenny, I'm sorry,
but get off my fucking windshield!

1176
01:26:45,076 --> 01:26:46,452
Stop!

1177
01:26:55,336 --> 01:26:56,546
Oh, God!

1178
01:27:06,806 --> 01:27:08,307
Dewey!

1179
01:27:09,392 --> 01:27:11,436
Dewey, where are you?

1180
01:27:13,479 --> 01:27:14,605
Dewey!

1181
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:18,025
Sidney?

1182
01:27:23,114 --> 01:27:24,157
Dewey!

1183
01:27:52,643 --> 01:27:54,187
Shit!

1184
01:28:20,421 --> 01:28:24,217
7825, suspect at 105 North Avenue 52.

1185
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:27,428
Hello. Help me, please.
I'm at Stu Marker's house on Turner Lane.

1186
01:28:27,512 --> 01:28:29,263
It's 261 Turner Lane.

1187
01:28:29,347 --> 01:28:31,224
Please. He's gonna try and kill me.

1188
01:28:54,413 --> 01:28:56,123
Sidney!

1189
01:28:57,041 --> 01:28:59,544
Sidney! Jesus, we've gotta
get the fuck out of here!

1190
01:29:00,044 --> 01:29:01,212
Stop right there!

1191
01:29:01,295 --> 01:29:03,381
Don't shoot. It's me!
I found Tatum. She's dead!

1192
01:29:03,464 --> 01:29:05,842
- I think Stu did it.
- Don't listen to him, Sidney!

1193
01:29:05,925 --> 01:29:07,468
- Stay back!
- Stu did it.

1194
01:29:07,552 --> 01:29:09,804
- He killed Billy. He killed my Tatum.
- You did it!

1195
01:29:09,887 --> 01:29:11,514
- He killed my Tatum!
- No, I didn't!

1196
01:29:11,597 --> 01:29:14,308
You lie! Sidney, baby.
Please, give me that gun!

1197
01:29:14,392 --> 01:29:16,143
Give me that gun! Christ, man!

1198
01:29:16,227 --> 01:29:20,940
No, I didn't. No, I didn't!
Sid, he did it! He did it, Sidney!

1199
01:29:21,023 --> 01:29:22,900
Please, I didn't do it. He did it. Please!

1200
01:29:22,984 --> 01:29:25,486
- Please, Sidney. Oh!
- Fuck you both!

1201
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:28,155
- Please!
- No! No! Sidney!

1202
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:30,449
Open up!

1203
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,663
Help me! He's going crazy!

1204
01:29:35,746 --> 01:29:37,957
- Sidney!
- Go away!

1205
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:39,542
Sidney?

1206
01:29:40,543 --> 01:29:42,044
Leave me alone.

1207
01:29:47,842 --> 01:29:49,135
- Sid.
- Billy.

1208
01:29:57,143 --> 01:29:58,436
Are you okay?

1209
01:29:58,519 --> 01:30:01,522
- I'm okay.
- I thought you were dead.

1210
01:30:01,606 --> 01:30:04,442
No. Bleeding like a stuck pig,
but I'm all right.

1211
01:30:04,525 --> 01:30:06,027
Get up.

1212
01:30:06,819 --> 01:30:08,571
- I'm okay.
- You're bleeding.

1213
01:30:09,864 --> 01:30:11,365
- Oh, my God.
- We've gotta get help.

1214
01:30:11,449 --> 01:30:12,533
No, he's out there!

1215
01:30:12,617 --> 01:30:14,911
No, give me the gun.
Give me the gun. It's okay.

1216
01:30:14,994 --> 01:30:16,621
It's okay. It's okay.

1217
01:30:17,663 --> 01:30:18,748
Careful.

1218
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:23,127
- Please help me!
- Whoa, whoa. Come here, come here!

1219
01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:25,504
Stu's flipped out! He's gone mad!

1220
01:30:27,924 --> 01:30:30,051
We all go a little mad sometimes.

1221
01:30:30,134 --> 01:30:32,011
- No, Billy!
- Oh, fuck!

1222
01:30:39,143 --> 01:30:41,354
Anthony Perkins, Psycho.

1223
01:30:48,277 --> 01:30:52,073
Corn syrup. Same stuff they used
for pig's blood in Carrie.

1224
01:30:53,366 --> 01:30:54,867
No.

1225
01:30:55,910 --> 01:30:57,203
Stu.

1226
01:30:57,703 --> 01:30:59,205
Help me, please.

1227
01:31:01,499 --> 01:31:03,751
Surprise, Sidney.

1228
01:31:07,755 --> 01:31:08,714
No!

1229
01:31:10,466 --> 01:31:11,968
Oh, now. Whoa.

1230
01:31:15,721 --> 01:31:18,391
What's the matter, Sidney?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

1231
01:31:19,392 --> 01:31:20,893
Why are you doing this?

1232
01:31:20,977 --> 01:31:23,187
It's all part of the game, Sidney.

1233
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:26,023
- It's called “Guess How I'm Gonna Die.”
- Fuck you!

1234
01:31:26,107 --> 01:31:28,150
No, no, no, no, no.

1235
01:31:28,234 --> 01:31:30,695
We already played that game, remember?

1236
01:31:30,778 --> 01:31:31,821
You lost.

1237
01:31:31,904 --> 01:31:33,823
It's a fun game, Sidney.

1238
01:31:33,906 --> 01:31:36,826
See, we ask you a question,
and if you get it wrong...

1239
01:31:36,909 --> 01:31:39,120
bookah— you die!

1240
01:31:39,203 --> 01:31:41,580
You get it right, you die.

1241
01:31:42,498 --> 01:31:44,250
You're crazy, both of you.

1242
01:31:44,333 --> 01:31:46,085
Actually, we prefer the term “psychotic.”

1243
01:31:46,168 --> 01:31:47,837
You'll never get away with this.

1244
01:31:48,879 --> 01:31:49,964
Oh, no?

1245
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:52,591
Tell that to Cotton Weary.

1246
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:56,053
You wouldn't believe
how easy he was to frame.

1247
01:31:56,887 --> 01:31:59,223
Watch a few movies, take a few notes.

1248
01:32:00,057 --> 01:32:01,392
It was fun.

1249
01:32:01,475 --> 01:32:02,435
No!

1250
01:32:02,518 --> 01:32:04,270
- Whoa!
- Where you goin'?

1251
01:32:05,354 --> 01:32:07,023
Why?

1252
01:32:08,649 --> 01:32:10,151
Why did you kill my mother?

1253
01:32:10,234 --> 01:32:12,903
Why? Why?

1254
01:32:14,864 --> 01:32:16,615
You hear that, Stu?
I think she wants a motive.

1255
01:32:18,868 --> 01:32:20,369
I don't really believe in motive, Sid.

1256
01:32:20,453 --> 01:32:21,996
Did Norman Bates have a motive?

1257
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:23,039
No.

1258
01:32:23,122 --> 01:32:26,959
Did they ever really decide why Hannibal
Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so!

1259
01:32:27,043 --> 01:32:29,545
See, it's a lot scarier
when there's no motive, Sid.

1260
01:32:31,005 --> 01:32:34,050
We did your mom a favor, Sid.
That woman was a slut-bag whore...

1261
01:32:34,133 --> 01:32:37,136
who flashed her shit all over town
like she was Sharon Stone.

1262
01:32:37,219 --> 01:32:39,638
Yeah, we put her out of her misery,
'cause let's face it, Sidney...

1263
01:32:39,722 --> 01:32:42,933
your mother was no Sharon Stone, huh?

1264
01:32:48,147 --> 01:32:49,732
Is that motive enough for you?

1265
01:32:52,985 --> 01:32:54,487
Well, how 'bout this?

1266
01:32:55,863 --> 01:32:59,533
Your slut mother was fucking my father...

1267
01:33:01,494 --> 01:33:04,371
and she's the reason
my mom moved out and abandoned me.

1268
01:33:07,249 --> 01:33:08,834
How's that for a motive?

1269
01:33:10,586 --> 01:33:12,671
Maternal abandonment
causes serious deviant behavior.

1270
01:33:12,755 --> 01:33:15,591
Certainly fucked you up.
It made you have sex with a psychopath.

1271
01:33:16,258 --> 01:33:18,469
That's right. You gave it up.

1272
01:33:18,552 --> 01:33:20,054
Now you're no longer a virgin.

1273
01:33:21,138 --> 01:33:22,765
I said “virgin.” Whoops!

1274
01:33:22,848 --> 01:33:25,810
Now you gotta die. Those are the rules.

1275
01:33:25,893 --> 01:33:30,022
Just pretend it's all a scary movie, Sid.
How do you think it's gonna end?

1276
01:33:34,735 --> 01:33:36,946
This is the greatest part!
You're gonna love this.

1277
01:33:37,029 --> 01:33:39,031
We got a surprise for you, Sidney.

1278
01:33:39,532 --> 01:33:42,284
Yeah, you're gonna love this one.
It's a scream, baby!

1279
01:33:42,368 --> 01:33:45,412
Hold on a sec. I'll be right back.

1280
01:33:46,497 --> 01:33:48,040
You know what time it is, Sid?

1281
01:33:48,541 --> 01:33:50,584
It's after midnight.

1282
01:33:50,668 --> 01:33:54,171
It's your mom's anniversary.
Congratulations.

1283
01:33:54,255 --> 01:33:56,549
We killed her exactly one year ago today.

1284
01:33:57,341 --> 01:33:59,051
Attention!

1285
01:33:59,802 --> 01:34:01,804
What do we have behind
door number three, Sidney?

1286
01:34:01,887 --> 01:34:03,597
- Daddy!
- Whoa, hold it.

1287
01:34:03,681 --> 01:34:05,516
That's enough.

1288
01:34:06,225 --> 01:34:08,102
Guess we won't be needing this anymore.

1289
01:34:08,894 --> 01:34:12,106
And look at this.
Ring, ring. Won't need this.

1290
01:34:12,189 --> 01:34:13,691
Got the ending figured out yet, Sid?

1291
01:34:13,774 --> 01:34:16,026
Come on, Sidney.
You think about it now, huh?

1292
01:34:16,110 --> 01:34:19,155
Your daddy's the chief suspect.
We cloned his cellular.

1293
01:34:19,238 --> 01:34:21,198
Evidence is all right there, baby!

1294
01:34:21,282 --> 01:34:23,617
What if your father snapped?
Your mother's anniversary set him off...

1295
01:34:23,701 --> 01:34:25,953
and he went on a murder spree,
killing everyone.

1296
01:34:26,036 --> 01:34:28,289
Except for Billy and me.
We were left for dead.

1297
01:34:28,372 --> 01:34:31,500
Then he... kills you...

1298
01:34:31,584 --> 01:34:33,252
and shoots himself in the head.

1299
01:34:34,211 --> 01:34:37,131
- Perfect ending.
- I thought of that.

1300
01:34:38,048 --> 01:34:39,550
Watch this.

1301
01:34:43,179 --> 01:34:45,222
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1302
01:34:45,306 --> 01:34:48,100
Yeah! I'm ready, baby!

1303
01:34:48,184 --> 01:34:52,313
Hit it! Get up! Yeah, babe, get up! Hit it!

1304
01:34:57,109 --> 01:34:59,695
Good one, man. Jesus.

1305
01:34:59,778 --> 01:35:02,615
Oh, shit. My turn.

1306
01:35:06,243 --> 01:35:08,954
Don't forget.
Stay to the side and don't go too deep.

1307
01:35:10,289 --> 01:35:12,625
Okay. I'll remember.

1308
01:35:14,752 --> 01:35:16,921
Fuck! Fuck!

1309
01:35:17,004 --> 01:35:19,131
Fuck! Goddamn it, Stu!

1310
01:35:19,715 --> 01:35:22,801
Sorry, Billy.
I guess I got a little too zealous, huh?

1311
01:35:24,094 --> 01:35:25,971
- Give me the knife.
- No.

1312
01:35:26,972 --> 01:35:28,849
Give me the knife!

1313
01:35:31,727 --> 01:35:32,519
Now!

1314
01:35:36,065 --> 01:35:40,694
You see, Sid, everybody dies but us.
Everybody dies but us.

1315
01:35:40,778 --> 01:35:43,239
We get to carry on and plan the sequel...

1316
01:35:43,322 --> 01:35:47,701
'cause let's face it, baby,
these days you gotta have a sequel!

1317
01:35:50,788 --> 01:35:53,332
You sick fucks.
You've seen one too many movies.

1318
01:35:53,415 --> 01:35:55,709
Now, Sid, don't you blame the movies.

1319
01:35:55,793 --> 01:35:59,713
Movies don't create psychos.
Movies make psychos more creative!

1320
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:03,467
Stop it, Billy, would you? All right?

1321
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:07,554
I can't take anymore.
I'm feeling a little woozy here!

1322
01:36:10,099 --> 01:36:13,978
All right. All right, you get the gun.

1323
01:36:14,061 --> 01:36:15,980
And I'll untie Pops, okay?

1324
01:36:19,358 --> 01:36:20,943
Now!

1325
01:36:21,026 --> 01:36:22,278
Okay.

1326
01:36:34,373 --> 01:36:37,543
Houston, we have a problem here.

1327
01:36:40,170 --> 01:36:42,381
- What?
- The gun, man. The gun.

1328
01:36:42,464 --> 01:36:45,009
I put it right there, and it's not there.

1329
01:36:46,385 --> 01:36:47,845
Where the fuck is it?

1330
01:36:47,928 --> 01:36:49,555
Right here, asshole.

1331
01:36:51,181 --> 01:36:53,309
Excuse me. I thought she was dead.

1332
01:36:53,392 --> 01:36:55,936
She looked dead, man. Still does.

1333
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:57,521
I've got an ending for you.

1334
01:36:57,604 --> 01:37:00,566
The reporter left for dead
in the news van...

1335
01:37:00,649 --> 01:37:02,151
comes to...

1336
01:37:02,776 --> 01:37:05,112
stumbles on you two dipshits...

1337
01:37:06,071 --> 01:37:07,323
finds the gun...

1338
01:37:07,406 --> 01:37:10,451
foils your plan and saves the day.

1339
01:37:12,202 --> 01:37:13,704
I like that ending.

1340
01:37:15,622 --> 01:37:17,249
I know something you don't.

1341
01:37:20,586 --> 01:37:21,754
Fuck. No!

1342
01:37:26,050 --> 01:37:27,551
Yeah, man.

1343
01:37:28,427 --> 01:37:33,223
Yeah. Aw, so sweet.

1344
01:37:37,311 --> 01:37:40,439
Works better without the safety on.

1345
01:37:48,364 --> 01:37:50,324
This is Gale Weathers, signing off.

1346
01:37:50,407 --> 01:37:52,659
Baby, you're gonna love this!

1347
01:37:54,953 --> 01:37:56,121
Shit.

1348
01:37:58,624 --> 01:37:59,666
What?

1349
01:38:06,382 --> 01:38:08,050
Where are they? Where are they?

1350
01:38:08,133 --> 01:38:10,386
I don't know, but I'm hurtin', man.

1351
01:38:10,469 --> 01:38:11,970
Fuck!

1352
01:38:14,264 --> 01:38:16,266
Should I let the machine get it?

1353
01:38:17,893 --> 01:38:19,978
- Hello?
- Are you alone in the house?

1354
01:38:20,729 --> 01:38:23,065
Bitch! You bitch! Where the fuck are you?

1355
01:38:23,148 --> 01:38:26,652
Not so fast. We're gonna play
a little game. It's called—

1356
01:38:26,735 --> 01:38:29,655
“Guess who just called the police
and reported your sorry motherfucking ass. ”

1357
01:38:30,489 --> 01:38:32,408
Find her, you dipshit! Get up!

1358
01:38:32,491 --> 01:38:34,660
I can't, Billy. You cut me too deep.

1359
01:38:34,743 --> 01:38:36,578
I think I'm dying here, man.

1360
01:38:40,165 --> 01:38:41,875
Talk to her. Talk to her.

1361
01:38:48,924 --> 01:38:50,467
Hello?

1362
01:38:50,551 --> 01:38:52,594
Oh, Stu, Stu, Stu.

1363
01:38:52,678 --> 01:38:54,555
What's your motive? Billy's got one.

1364
01:38:54,638 --> 01:38:56,890
The police are on their way.
What are you gonna tell them?

1365
01:38:56,974 --> 01:38:59,351
Peer pressure. I'm far too sensitive.

1366
01:38:59,435 --> 01:39:02,020
I'm gonna rip you up,
you bitch, just like your fucking mother!

1367
01:39:02,104 --> 01:39:04,106
You've gotta find me first,
you pansy-assed mama's boy!

1368
01:39:04,189 --> 01:39:05,524
Fuck!

1369
01:39:05,607 --> 01:39:08,652
Ow. You fuckin' hit me with the phone, dick!

1370
01:39:09,778 --> 01:39:11,280
Fucker, where are you?

1371
01:39:13,490 --> 01:39:14,616
You fuck!

1372
01:39:16,994 --> 01:39:18,454
Did you really call the police?

1373
01:39:18,537 --> 01:39:20,330
You bet your sorry ass I did.

1374
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:24,376
My mom and dad are gonna be so mad at me.

1375
01:39:25,544 --> 01:39:26,920
Bitch!

1376
01:40:23,769 --> 01:40:25,312
My arm!

1377
01:40:33,612 --> 01:40:36,073
I always had a thing for you, Sid!

1378
01:40:41,745 --> 01:40:42,746
Bitch.

1379
01:40:43,789 --> 01:40:45,290
In your dreams.

1380
01:41:10,357 --> 01:41:11,775
I'm sorry. It's all right.

1381
01:41:11,858 --> 01:41:13,443
Oh, my God, Randy,
I thought you were dead.

1382
01:41:13,527 --> 01:41:16,989
I probably should be. I never thought
I'd be so happy to be a virgin.

1383
01:41:18,574 --> 01:41:19,700
Fucker!

1384
01:41:26,331 --> 01:41:27,874
Say hello to your mother.

1385
01:41:58,572 --> 01:42:00,365
Come on.

1386
01:42:03,535 --> 01:42:04,786
It's okay.

1387
01:42:08,415 --> 01:42:11,209
Guess I remembered the safety that time,
you bastard.

1388
01:42:23,972 --> 01:42:25,432
Careful.

1389
01:42:25,515 --> 01:42:29,186
This is the moment when the supposedly
dead killer comes back to life...

1390
01:42:29,269 --> 01:42:31,229
for one last scare.

1391
01:42:36,318 --> 01:42:37,819
Not in my movie.

1392
01:42:43,659 --> 01:42:44,868
Dad.

1393
01:42:45,952 --> 01:42:47,454
Randy, help me out.

1394
01:42:52,084 --> 01:42:53,126
You okay?

1395
01:42:54,044 --> 01:42:55,545
I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1396
01:42:56,546 --> 01:42:58,256
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1397
01:42:59,925 --> 01:43:01,885
- Hang in there, buddy.
- All right.

1398
01:43:04,388 --> 01:43:05,430
- Over here.
- Sorry, kid.

1399
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:09,768
Okay, I think it's gonna go something
like this. Just stay with me.

1400
01:43:11,269 --> 01:43:12,688
Hi. This is Gale Weathers...

1401
01:43:12,771 --> 01:43:16,983
with an exclusive eyewitness account
of this amazing breaking story.

1402
01:43:17,984 --> 01:43:20,028
Several more local teens are dead...

1403
01:43:20,112 --> 01:43:23,490
bringing to an end the harrowing mystery
of the mass killing...

1404
01:43:23,573 --> 01:43:28,120
that has terrified this peaceful community
like the plot of some scary movie.

1405
01:43:28,787 --> 01:43:31,248
It all began with a scream over 9-1-1...

1406
01:43:31,331 --> 01:43:35,043
and ended in a bloodbath
that has rocked the town of Woodsboro...

1407
01:43:35,794 --> 01:43:38,171
all played out here
in this peaceful farmhouse...

1408
01:43:38,255 --> 01:43:43,051
far from the crimes and the sirens of the
larger cities that its residents had fled.

1409
01:43:43,135 --> 01:43:45,762
Okay, let's take it back to one.
Come on, move it.

1410
01:43:45,846 --> 01:43:47,347
This is my big shot. Let's go.

1410
01:43:48,305 --> 01:44:48,576
