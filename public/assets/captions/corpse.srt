1
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:02,010
Here ye, here ye, 10 minutes to go
till Van Dort's wedding rehearsal.

2
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,720
Watch it!

3
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,800
- It's a beautiful day
- It's a rather nice day

4
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,130
A day for a glorious wedding

5
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,070
A rehearsal, my dear
To be perfectly clear

6
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,640
A rehearsal for a glorious wedding

7
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,750
Assuming nothing happens
That we don't really know

8
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,320
That nothing unexpected
Interferes with the show

9
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,880
And that's why everything
Every last little thing

10
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,890
Every single, tiny, microscopic little thing
Must go

11
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,960
- According to plan
- Our son will be married

12
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,220
- According to plan
- Our family carried

13
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,200
Elevated to the heights of society

14
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,990
- To the costume balls
- In the hallowed halls

15
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,330
Rubbing elbows with the finest

16
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,130
Having crumpets with Her Highness

17
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,100
We'll be there, we'll be seen
Having tea with the queen

18
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,910
We'll forget everything
That we've ever, ever been

19
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,280
- Blimey! It's my dress is caught.
- Begging your pardon, ma'am.

20
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,910
- Come on, dear.
- It's not me. It's my dress is caught.

21
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,920
Where is Victor? We might be late.

22
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,830
Fish merchants.

23
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,960
- It's a terrible day
- Now, don't be that way

24
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,660
It's a terrible day for a wedding

25
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,830
It's a sad, sad state of affairs we're in

26
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,210
That has led to this ominous wedding

27
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,540
How could our family have come to this?

28
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,710
To marry off our daughter
To the nouveau riche

29
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,380
- They're so common
- So coarse

30
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,350
- Oh, it couldn't be worse
- Couldn't be worse? I'm afraid I disagree

31
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,190
They could be land-rich,
Bankrupt aristocracy

32
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,760
Without a penny to their name

33
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,330
Just like you and me

34
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,260
Oh, dear.

35
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,740
And that's why everything
Every last little thing

36
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,670
Every single, tiny, microscopic little thing
Must go

37
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,910
- According to plan
- Our daughter will wed

38
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,980
- According to plan
- Our family led

39
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,950
From the depths of deepest poverty

40
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,880
- To the noble realm
- Of our ancestry

41
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,890
And who would have guessed
In a million years

42
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,260
- That our daughter with a face
- Of an otter in disgrace

43
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,960
Would provide our ticket
To a rightful place

44
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,840
Oh, Hildegarde.

45
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,640
What if Victor and I
don't like each other?

46
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,280
As if that has anything
to do with marriage.

47
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,080
Do you suppose your father and I
like each other?

48
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,780
Surely you must a little?

49
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,890
- Of course not.
- Of course not.

50
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,000
Get those corsets laced properly.

51
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,030
I can hear you speak without gasping.

52
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,700
You've certainly hooked a winner
this time, Victor.

53
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,640
- Now, all you have to do is reel her in.
- I'm already reeling, Mother.

54
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,940
Shouldn't Victoria Everglot
be marrying a lord or something?

55
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,450
Oh, nonsense! We're every bit
as good as the Everglots.

56
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,990
I always knew I deserved better
than a fish merchant's life.

57
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,460
But I've never even spoken to her.

58
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,220
Well, at least we have that
in our favor.

59
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,390
Mayhew! Silence that blasted coughing.

60
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,400
Marriage is a partnership,
a little tit for tat.

61
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,340
You'd think a lifetime watching us...

62
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,210
Might have taught her that

63
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,510
- Might have taught her that
- Everything must be perfect

64
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,520
- Everything must be perfect
- Everything must be perfect

65
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,350
Perfect
That's why everything

66
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,920
Every last little thing

67
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,250
Every single, tiny, microscopic little thing
Must go

68
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,390
According to plan

69
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,090
Look at the way you're standing.

70
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,030
You look like you got rickets
or something...

71
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:39,780
Oh, my goodness. Oh, such grandeur!
Such impeccable taste!

72
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,820
Oh, beautiful, innit?

73
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,580
It's not as big as our place, dear.

74
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,460
- Bit shabby really, isn't it?
- Shut up.

75
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,400
Lord and Lady Everglot...

76
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,230
...Mr. And Mrs. Van Dort.

77
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,900
Why, you must be Miss Victoria.

78
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,770
Yes, I must say, you don't look a day
over 20. No. Oh, yes.

79
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,580
Smile, darling, smile.

80
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,720
Well, hello. What a pleasure.
Welcome to our home.

81
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,490
Thank you.

82
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,990
We'll be taking tea
in the west drawing room.

83
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,030
Oh, do come this way,
it's just through there.

84
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,430
Oh, I love what you've done with the place.
Who is your decorator?

85
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,630
Nice tiles, shame about the drapes.

86
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,300
My husband says such foolish things.
Ignore him.

87
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,900
Yes, it's usually best.

88
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,900
- Do forgive me.
- You play beautifully.

89
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:18,340
I... I... I do apologize, Miss Everglot.
How rude of me to... Well...

90
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,570
Excuse me.

91
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,280
Mother won't let me near the piano.

92
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,280
Music is improper for a young lady.

93
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,010
Too passionate, she says.

94
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,990
If I may ask, Miss Everglot...

95
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,460
...where is your chaperon?

96
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,330
Perhaps, in...
In view of the circumstances...

97
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,670
...you could call me Victoria.

98
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,800
Yes, of course. Well...

99
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,040
- Victoria...
- Yes, Victor.

100
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,940
Tomorrow, we are to be m...

101
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,880
M... M...

102
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,450
- Married.
- Yes. Married.

103
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,950
Since I was a child, I've...
I've dreamt of my wedding day.

104
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,500
I always hoped to find someone
I was deeply in love with.

105
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,870
Someone to spend
the rest of my life with.

106
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,200
- Silly, isn't it?
- Yes, silly.

107
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,670
No. No, not at all, no.

108
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,830
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

109
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,450
What impropriety is this?

110
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,610
You shouldn't be alone together.

111
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:41,320
Here it is, one minute before 5,
and you're not at the rehearsal.

112
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,950
Pastor Galswells is waiting.
Come at once.

113
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,570
Master Van Dort,
from the beginning. Again.

114
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:57,010
"With this hand,
I will lift your sorrows.

115
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:03,210
Your cup will never empty,
for I will be your wine.

116
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:09,410
With this candle,
I will light your way in darkness.

117
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:14,650
With this ring, I ask you to be mine."

118
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,260
- Let's try it again.
- Yes. Yes, sir.

119
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,830
With this candle...

120
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,070
This candle...

121
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,170
This candle.

122
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,970
- Shall I get up there and do it for him?
- Don't get all aflutter, dear.

123
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,910
With this candle...

124
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,020
Continue!

125
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,290
Get the door, Emil.

126
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,690
Let's just pick it up at the candle bit.

127
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,130
A Lord Barkis, sir.

128
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,340
I haven't a head for dates.

129
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,500
Apparently,
I'm a day early for the ceremony.

130
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,810
- Is he from your side of the family?
- I can't recall.

131
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,610
Emil, a seat for Lord Barkis.

132
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,790
Do carry on.

133
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,370
Let's try it again, shall we,
Master Van Dort?

134
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:32,730
- Yes. Yes, sir. Certainly.
- Right.

135
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,810
Right. Oh, right!

136
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,140
- With this... This...
- Hand.

137
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,210
With this hand...

138
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,870
...I... With...

139
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,320
Three steps, three!

140
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:51,950
Can you not count? Do you not wish
to be married, Master Van Dort?

141
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,820
- No! No.
- You do not?

142
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:57,990
No! I meant, no,
I do not not wish to be married.

143
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,560
That is, I want very much to...

144
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,000
Pay attention! Have you
even remembered to bring the ring?

145
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,800
The ring? Yes. Of course.

146
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,610
- Dropping the ring.
- Oh, no, he's dropped the ring!

147
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,510
- This boy doesn't want to get married.
- How disgraceful!

148
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,580
Excuse me. Got it!

149
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,490
Out of the way, you ninny.

150
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:30,990
Oh, dear! Oh, my! Giddy on, there's a
woman on fire! Help! Emergency!

151
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:37,030
- Oh, I hope it doesn't stain.
- Stop fanning it, you fool.

152
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,970
- Get a bucket, get a bucket.
- I'm on my way, dear. Yes. Oh, dear!

153
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,920
Enough! This wedding cannot take place
until he is properly prepared.

154
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:06,060
Young man, learn your vows.

155
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:24,750
Well, he's quite the catch, isn't he?

156
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,190
Oh, Victoria.

157
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:45,600
She must think I'm such a fool.
This day couldn't get any worse.

158
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:51,870
Hear ye, hear ye! Rehearsal in ruins
as Van Dort boy causes chaos!

159
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,940
Fishy fianc� could be canned!

160
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,780
Everglots all fired up
as Van Dort disaster ruins rehearsal!

161
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,950
It really shouldn't be all that difficult.

162
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,290
It's just a few simple vows.

163
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,520
With this hand, I will take your wine.

164
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,100
No.

165
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,030
With this hand...

166
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,870
...I will cup your...

167
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,600
Oh, goodness, no.

168
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,670
With this...

169
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,740
With this...

170
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,470
With this candle, I will...

171
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,740
I will...

172
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,550
I will set your mother on fire.

173
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,150
Oh, it's no use.

174
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:57,330
With this hand,
I will lift your sorrows.

175
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:02,170
Your cup will never empty,
for I will be your wine.

176
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,150
Mrs. Everglot.

177
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,020
You look ravishing this evening.

178
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:13,950
What's that, Mr. Everglot?
Call you "Dad"? If you insist, sir.

179
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:18,620
With this candle,
I will light your way in darkness.

180
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,790
With this ring...

181
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:25,160
...I ask you to be mine.

182
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,820
I do.

183
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,450
You may kiss the bride.

184
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,650
- A new arrival.
- He must've fainted.

185
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,630
- Are you all right?
- What..? What happened?

186
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,860
By Jove, man. Looks like
we've got ourselves a breather.

187
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,170
- Does he have a dead brother?
- He's still soft.

188
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,800
A toast, then.

189
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,110
To the newlyweds.

190
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,510
Newlyweds?

191
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,580
In the woods,
you said your vows so perfectly.

192
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,350
I did?

193
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,960
I did.

194
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,360
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

195
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,420
Coming through, coming through.

196
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,470
My name is Paul, I am the head waiter.

197
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,600
I will be creating your wedding feast.

198
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,210
Wedding feast! I'm salivating.

199
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,400
Maggots.

200
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,910
Keep away!

201
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,550
I've got a...
I've got a dwarf.

202
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,020
And I'm not afraid to use him.
I want some questions. Now!

203
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:13,150
- Answers. I think you mean "answers."
- Thank you, yes, answers.

204
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,930
I need answers.
What's going on here? Where am I?

205
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,230
Who are you?

206
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,770
Well, that's kind of a long story.

207
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,540
What a story it is.

208
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:28,270
A tragic tale of romance, passion...

209
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,240
...and murder most foul.

210
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,010
This is gonna be good.

211
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,780
Hit it, boys.

212
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:50,030
Hey, give me a listen
You corpses of cheer

213
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,930
At least those of you
Who still got an ear

214
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,900
I'll tell you a story
Make a skeleton cry

215
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,570
Of our own jubiliciously
Lovely Corpse Bride

216
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,150
Die, die, we all pass away

217
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:05,080
But don't wear a frown
Because it's really okay

218
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,780
You might try and hide
And you might try and pray

219
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:11,050
But we all end up
The remains of the day

220
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,620
That's right.

221
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,950
Well, our girl was a beauty
Known for miles around

222
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,070
When a mysterious stranger
Came into town

223
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,860
He was plenty good-looking
But down on his cash

224
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,940
And our poor little baby
She fell hard and fast

225
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,940
When her daddy said no
She just couldn't cope

226
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,670
So our lovers came up
With a plan to elope

227
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,820
Die, die, we all pass away

228
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,080
But don't wear a frown
Because it's really okay

229
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,780
You might try and hide
And you might try and pray

230
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,120
But we all end up
The remains of the day

231
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,400
That's right.

232
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,640
Okay. Oh, yeah.
Come on, boys, pick it up.

233
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,580
Yeah. Like it.

234
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,650
Okay, Chancy, take it.

235
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,150
Yeah.

236
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,360
Yeah!

237
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,210
That's nice.

238
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,810
So they conjured up a plan
To meet late at night

239
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,350
They told not a soul
Kept the whole thing tight

240
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,040
Now, her mother's wedding dress
Fit like a glove

241
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,780
You don't need much
When you're really in love

242
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,290
Except for a few things
Or so I'm told

243
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,050
Like the family jewels
And a satchel of gold

244
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,720
Then next to the graveyard
By the old oak tree

245
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,160
On a dark foggy night
At a quarter to 3

246
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:02,770
She was ready to go
But where was he?

247
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,770
And then?

248
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,870
- She waited
- And then?

249
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,910
- There in the shadows, was it her man?
- And then?

250
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,510
- Her little heart beat so loud
- And then?

251
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,810
And then, baby, everything went black

252
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,310
Now, when she opened her eyes
She was dead as dust

253
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:24,350
Her jewels were missing
And her heart was bust

254
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,080
So she made a vow
Lying under that tree

255
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,060
That she'd wait for her true love
To come set her free

256
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:33,060
Always waiting for someone
To ask for her hand

257
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,570
Then out of the blue
Comes this groovy young man

258
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,470
Who vows forever
To be by her side

259
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,470
And that's the story
Of our Corpse Bride

260
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,410
Die, die, we all pass away

261
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,340
But don't wear a frown,
Because it's really okay

262
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,310
You might try and hide
And you might try and pray

263
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,080
But we all end up
The remains of the day

264
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,850
Yeah.

265
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,200
Victoria, come away from the window.

266
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,500
Oh, I'm sure he'll be back shortly.

267
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,870
He's terrified of the dark.
In fact, when he was a boy...

268
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:24,110
...he used to wet his combinations
regularly, didn't he, William?

269
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,480
Enter.

270
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:33,450
Lord Barkis.
I trust the room is to your liking.

271
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:37,190
Thank you,
you are a most gracious hostess.

272
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:43,490
Which is why it pains me
to be the bearer of such bad news.

273
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,270
Would you care
to repeat tonight's headline for us?

274
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,430
Hear ye, hear ye!

275
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:58,210
Victor Van Dort seen this night on the
bridge in the arms of a mystery woman!

276
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,840
The dark-haired temptress and Master
Van Dort slipped away into the night!

277
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,890
And now, the weather.
Scattered showers...

278
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,530
Enough! That will be all.

279
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,020
Mystery woman?
He doesn't even know any women!

280
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,260
Or so you thought.

281
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,540
Do call for me
if you need my assistance...

282
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,770
...in any way.

283
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,210
Good heavens, Finis,
what should we do?

284
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,870
Fetch me musket.

285
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,480
William, do something.

286
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:33,170
The town crier
probably just had a slow news day.

287
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:36,150
You know how it is,
you need a little something to cry about.

288
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,820
Regardless, we are one groom short
for the wedding tomorrow.

289
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:44,160
Not to mention
the financial implications.

290
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,130
A most scandalous embarrassment
for us all.

291
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,740
Oh, give us a chance to find him,
we beg of you.

292
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,740
- Just give us until dawn.
- Very well. Till dawn.

293
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,900
Victor, darling, where are you?

294
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,010
If you ask me,
your boyfriend is kind of jumpy.

295
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,580
He's not my boyfriend,
he's my husband.

296
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,190
Victor, where have you gone?

297
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,220
I'll keep an eye out for him.

298
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:11,680
Victor?

299
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:18,920
There he goes, there he goes!
He's... He's getting away!

300
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,160
Quick, quick, after him!

301
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,560
Victor.

302
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,230
Thank you.

303
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:30,970
Victor!

304
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,500
Where are you?

305
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,040
Victor?

306
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,740
Where have you gone?

307
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,850
Married, huh? I'm a widow.

308
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,820
Oh, how rude. He went that way!

309
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,220
Victor.

310
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,260
Victor, darling.

311
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,500
Please. There's been a mistake.
I'm not dead.

312
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:04,000
Excuse me. Excuse me.

313
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,070
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

314
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,140
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

315
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,410
Victor.

316
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,440
- Dead end.
- Victor!

317
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,190
Hello!

318
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,290
Could have used the stairs, silly.

319
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:34,970
Isn't the view beautiful?
It takes my breath away.

320
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,440
Well, it would if I had any.

321
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,310
Isn't it romantic?

322
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,990
Look, I am terribly sorry
about what's happened to you...

323
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,460
...and I'd like to help,
but I really need to get home.

324
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:59,790
- This is your home now.
- But I don't even know your name.

325
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,420
Well, that's a great way
to start a marriage.

326
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,000
Shut up!

327
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,870
- It's Emily.
- Emily.

328
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,880
Oh, I almost forgot.
I have something for you.

329
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,840
It's a wedding present.

330
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,260
Thank you.

331
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,450
Scraps?

332
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,290
Scraps!

333
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,420
My dog, Scraps!

334
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:05,900
Oh, Scraps, what a good boy.

335
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,230
I knew you'd be happy to see him.

336
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,600
Who's my good boy?
Sit. Sit, Scraps, sit.

337
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,040
Good boy, Scraps.
Roll over. Roll over.

338
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:19,110
Good boy, Scraps.
Play dead.

339
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,280
Sorry.

340
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,340
Oh, what a cutie.

341
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,580
You should have seen him with fur.

342
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,290
Mother never approved
of Scraps jumping up like this.

343
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,890
But then again,
she never approved of anything.

344
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,880
Do you think
she would have approved of me?

345
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,600
You're lucky
you'll never have to meet her.

346
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,130
Well, actually...

347
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:48,400
...now that you mention it,
I think you should.

348
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:51,570
In fact, since we're, you know...

349
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:55,310
...married,
you should definitely meet her.

350
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,480
And my father too. We should go
and see them right now.

351
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:01,410
What a fantastic idea!
Where are they buried?

352
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,480
- What? What is it?
- They're not from around here.

353
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,180
Where are they?

354
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,820
Oh, they're still alive.

355
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,120
- I'm afraid so.
- Well, that is a problem.

356
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,660
What's that, Scraps?

357
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,970
Oh, no, we couldn't possibly.

358
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:23,640
- Oh, well, if you put it like that.
- What?

359
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,530
Elder Gutknecht.

360
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:35,980
Scraps.

361
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,490
Elder Gutknecht...

362
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,380
...are you there?

363
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:46,360
Hello? Is anyone home?

364
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,700
Hello?

365
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,810
There you are!

366
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,880
Oh, my dear. There you are.

367
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:07,480
I've brought my husband, Victor.

368
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,450
What's that? Husband?

369
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,050
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

370
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:18,300
We need to go up. Upstairs?
To visit the land of the living.

371
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,690
Land of the living?

372
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,730
Oh, my dear.

373
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,700
Please, Elder Gutknecht.

374
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,700
Now, why go up there, when
people are dying to get down here?

375
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:33,930
Sir, I beg you to help.
It means so much to me...

376
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,170
- Us.
- I don't know, it's just not natural.

377
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,250
Please, Elder Gutknecht.

378
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,050
Surely there must be something
you can do.

379
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,620
Let me see what I can do.

380
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,860
Where did I put that book?

381
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:00,760
I left it here somewhere.

382
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,270
There's the one.

383
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,580
I have it.

384
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:26,660
A Ukrainian haunting spell.
Just the thing for these quick trips.

385
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:31,060
- So glad you thought of this.
- Me too.

386
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,060
Now, then...

387
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,660
...where were we?

388
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,950
The Ukrainian haunting spell?

389
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:14,040
Here we have it. Ready?

390
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:18,150
Just remember, when you
want to come back, say "Hopscotch."

391
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:21,040
- Hopscotch?
- That's it.

392
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,800
I spent so long in the darkness...

393
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:44,670
...I�d almost forgotten how beautiful
the moonlight is.

394
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,230
Hey, I think you dropped something.

395
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,980
Hold on, hold on.

396
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:41,330
I think I should prepare Mother
and Father for the big news.

397
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,970
I'll go ahead and you...

398
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,270
...wait here.

399
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,460
- Perfect.
- I won't be long.

400
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,240
Stay right here. I'll be right back.

401
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:55,970
Okay.

402
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,410
No peeking.

403
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:20,600
If ever I see that Van Dort boy...

404
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:24,030
...I'll strangle him with my bare hands.

405
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:28,370
Your hands are too fat,
and his neck is too thin.

406
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,910
You'll have to use a rope.

407
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:45,620
This is the voice of your conscience.
Listen to what I say.

408
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:49,990
I have a bad feeling about that boy.
You know he is no...

409
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,470
Go chew someone else's ear for a while.

410
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,370
Victor has gone to see his parents,
just like he said.

411
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,880
If I hadn't just been sitting in it,
I would say that you had lost your mind!

412
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:07,510
I'm sure he has a perfectly
good reason for taking so long.

413
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,880
I am sure he does.
Why don't you go ask him?

414
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,110
All right, I will.

415
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:16,850
After all, he couldn't get far
with those cold feet.

416
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:59,320
- Victoria.
- Victor? I'm so happy to see you.

417
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:03,490
Come by the fire. Where have you been?
Are you all right?

418
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,700
I... I...

419
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,240
Oh, dear.

420
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,670
You're as cold as death.
What's happened to you?

421
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,710
Your coat.

422
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,420
Victoria, I confess.

423
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,780
This morning
I was terrified of marriage.

424
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:27,820
But then, on meeting you,
I felt I should be with you always...

425
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,190
...and that our wedding
could not come soon enough.

426
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,610
Victor, I feel the same.

427
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:46,140
Victoria, I se... I se...

428
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,880
I seem to find myself married.

429
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,780
And you should know it's unexpected.

430
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,960
My darling,
I just wanted to meet...

431
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,390
Darling? Who's this?

432
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:07,000
- Who is she?
- I'm his wife.

433
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,960
- Victor?
- Victoria, wait. You don't understand.

434
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,670
She's dead. Look.

435
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,640
Hopscotch.

436
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,320
No! No! Victoria!

437
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,160
You lied to me!

438
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:33,820
Just to get back to that other woman.

439
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,930
Don't you understand?
You're the other woman.

440
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:41,630
No! You're married to me.
She's the other woman.

441
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:47,040
She's got a point.

442
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:52,870
And I thought... I thought
this was all going so well.

443
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,020
Look, I'm sorry, but...

444
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,660
...this just can't work.

445
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,760
Why not?

446
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:11,960
It's my eye, isn't it?

447
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,800
No. Your eye is...

448
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,200
...lovely.

449
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:21,440
Listen, under different circumstances,
well, who knows?

450
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:26,210
But we're just too different.
I mean, you're dead.

451
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,410
You should've thought about that
before you asked me to marry you.

452
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:33,110
Why can't you understand? It was
a mistake. I would never marry you.

453
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,220
Roses for eternal love.

454
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:09,690
Lilies for sweetness.

455
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,020
Baby's breath.

456
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,430
Why so blue?

457
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,660
Maybe he's right.
Maybe we are too different.

458
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,430
Maybe he should
have his head examined.

459
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,770
I could do it.

460
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:34,440
Or perhaps he does belong with her.
Little Miss Living.

461
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:37,980
With her rosy cheeks and beating heart.

462
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:42,690
Oh, those girls are ten a penny.
You've got so much more.

463
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,160
You've got... You've got...

464
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:47,820
You've got a wonderful personality.

465
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:59,340
What does that wispy little brat have
That you don't have double?

466
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:03,140
She can't hold a candle
To the beauty of your smile

467
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,570
How about a pulse?

468
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,080
Overrated by a mile

469
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,510
- Overvalued
- Overblown

470
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:11,520
If he only knew
The you that we know

471
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,790
And that silly little creature
Isn't wearing his ring

472
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,360
And she doesn't play piano
Or dance, or sing

473
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,290
No, she doesn't compare

474
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,730
- But she still breathes air
- Who cares?

475
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,160
- Unimportant
- Overrated

476
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:27,530
- Overblown
- lf only he could see

477
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,330
How special you can be

478
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,530
If he only knew
The you that we know

479
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:44,320
If I touch a burning candle
I can feel no pain

480
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:48,780
If you cut me with a knife
It's still the same

481
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:53,490
And I know her heart is beating

482
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:56,430
And I know that I am dead

483
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,260
Yet the pain here that I feel

484
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,500
Try and tell me it's not real

485
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:07,540
And it seems that I still have
A tear to shed

486
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:15,280
The sole redeeming feature
From that little creature

487
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,820
Is that she's alive

488
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,610
- Overrated
- Overblown

489
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:21,810
Everybody knows
That's just a temporary state

490
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:25,190
Which is cured very quickly
When we meet our fate

491
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,880
- Who cares?
- Unimportant

492
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,430
- Overrated
- Overblown

493
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,860
If only he could see
How special you can be

494
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:36,490
If he only knew
The you that we know

495
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:47,110
If I touch a burning candle
I can feel no pain

496
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,540
In the ice or in the sun
It's all the same

497
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,980
Yet I feel my heart is aching

498
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,290
Though it doesn't beat, it's breaking

499
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,990
And the pain here that I feel

500
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:04,700
Try and tell me it's not real

501
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,160
I know that I am dead

502
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:13,560
Yet it seems that I still have
Some tears to shed

503
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,620
It's true, Mother!

504
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,550
Victor is married to a dead woman.

505
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,490
I saw her. A corpse!
Standing right here with Victor.

506
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,220
Victor was in your room?

507
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,760
I have to help him.

508
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,460
The scandal!

509
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:41,470
Come sit in your chair, dearie.
You're shaking like a leaf.

510
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,660
Let Hilde fetch you a blanket.

511
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,240
Fetch her a straitjacket!
She's completely mad!

512
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:49,270
Come, Hildegarde.

513
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:25,480
Finis, come to bed at once.

514
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:49,200
What in heaven's name?

515
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:54,800
Who could that be at this hour?

516
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,610
Miss Everglot.

517
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:02,310
What are you doing here? You should be
at home, prostrate with grief.

518
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,180
Pastor Galswells,
I have to ask you something.

519
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:08,750
- This is most irregular.
- Please, I beg of you.

520
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,420
You are the only one in the village who
knows of what awaits beyond the grave.

521
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,330
A grim topic for a bride-to-be.

522
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:21,470
It is a bride I fear,
which is why I must know:

523
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,200
Can the living marry the dead?

524
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:27,240
What on earth are you speaking about?

525
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:30,380
Please, it's Victor.
He's married to a corpse.

526
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:33,040
He has a corpse bride!

527
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:36,910
There must be some way
to undo what's been done.

528
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,290
I believe I know the thing to do.

529
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,320
Come with me.

530
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:49,620
Victoria? Where are your corsets?

531
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,500
She's speaking in tongues.
Of unholy alliances.

532
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,930
Her mind has come undone, I fear.

533
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,230
It's not true! Let me go! Let me go!

534
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:03,110
Thank you, Pastor Galswells.
Thank you so very much.

535
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:05,080
Take her to her room!

536
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,680
No, I'm telling the truth.

537
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:09,710
Victor needs my help.

538
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:12,120
Hildegarde, you believe me, don't you?

539
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:15,220
- Mother, Father, please.
- Seal the doors...

540
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:19,850
...and bar the windows. See to it that
she doesn't escape again.

541
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:24,430
He needs our help! Oh, let me go!
Let me go!

542
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:28,630
Will the mortification never cease?

543
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,000
It will be years before we can show
ourselves in public again.

544
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:33,440
What shall we do?

545
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:37,240
We shall continue as planned,
with or without Vincent.

546
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:39,680
- Victor.
- Whatever.

547
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:44,580
For that boy to toss aside
a young woman like Victoria...

548
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,780
...it's positively criminal.

549
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,150
Why, if I had a woman
like your daughter on my arm...

550
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:55,920
...I would lavish her with riches
befitting royalty.

551
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:59,760
Your lady wife
is a most fortunate woman.

552
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,800
Alas, I am not married.

553
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:04,840
I was betrothed some years ago...

554
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:08,940
...but tragedy snatched
my young bride away.

555
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:13,170
When one lives alone,
wealth counts for naught.

556
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:25,190
Marvelous news, Victoria,
there'll be a wedding after all.

557
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,660
You found him?

558
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:30,290
Make haste, my dear,
our relatives will arrive at any moment.

559
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:34,270
We must have you looking presentable
for Lord Barkis.

560
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,200
Lord Barkis?

561
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:38,900
He will make a fine husband.

562
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:42,410
Aye. A fortuitous turn of events indeed.

563
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:44,840
A far better prospect this time.

564
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:48,710
But I do not love him.
You cannot make me do this.

565
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,750
- We must.
- Please, I beg of you.

566
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,350
There must be another way.

567
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,460
Without your marriage to Lord Barkis...

568
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:58,110
...we shall be forced,
penniless, into the street.

569
00:47:58,290 --> 00:47:59,730
We are destitute.

570
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,860
But Victor...

571
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:04,560
Victor Van Dort has gone, child.

572
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:07,760
You shall marry Lord Barkis tomorrow.

573
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:12,700
- According to plan.
- According to plan.

574
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,100
Oh, my dear.
Oh, don't look at me that way.

575
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:49,610
You have only to suffer this union
until death do us part.

576
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:53,610
And that will come sooner
than you think.

577
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,890
Oh, it's almost dawn!
Where could he be?

578
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:02,110
Victor Van Dort elopes with corpse!

579
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:05,990
Heartbroken bride to wed
wealthy newcomer!

580
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,820
Wealthy newcomer? It cannot be.

581
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,760
Did he say corpse?

582
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:14,770
Oh, don't be ridiculous. What corpse
would marry our Victor?

583
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:20,930
Oh, Mayhew!
Silence that blasted coughing.

584
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:40,090
Mayhew, are you trying to kill us?

585
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,530
I think he's trying to kill us.

586
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,030
I...

587
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:26,100
...think you dropped this.

588
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,550
I'm sorry.

589
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:40,680
I'm sorry I lied to you
about wanting to see my parents.

590
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:45,190
It's just this whole day
hasn't gone quite, well...

591
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:49,490
...according to plan.

592
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:56,660
Pardon my enthusiasm.

593
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,060
I like your enthusiasm.

594
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:07,160
- New arrival! New arrival!
- Lights up!

595
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:12,040
Hurry up, boys!

596
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:16,610
Drinks for everyone.

597
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:17,880
Another pint, sir?

598
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:20,080
- No, no. Just a half.
- No, no. Just a half.

599
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:27,990
It is impossible
to get good help anymore.

600
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,890
Welcoming committee, coming through!
Coming through!

601
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:35,870
- My name's Plum. Miss Plum.
- Mayhew?

602
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:39,810
Mayhew! How nice to see...

603
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,240
I'm so sorry.

604
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:47,780
Oh, yeah. Actually, though, I feel great.

605
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:53,720
Hurry up, boys. Can you not see
the gentleman is parched?

606
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:57,560
Mayhew, I have to get back.

607
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:00,290
They all must be worried sick.
How is everyone?

608
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:04,420
Well, they're still wondering
where you slipped off to.

609
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,790
Oh, and Miss Victoria...

610
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:08,530
Yes? Yes, how is she?

611
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,640
Well, she's getting married
this evening.

612
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:13,800
What? Married to who?

613
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:17,640
Some newcomer,
Lord Somebody-or-Other.

614
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:19,140
But that's impossible!

615
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,480
Yeah, with you gone and all...

616
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:25,020
I guess they didn't wanna
waste the cake.

617
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:28,080
But how could she?

618
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:31,160
Women, you can't live with them.

619
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:33,590
You can't live with...

620
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:40,660
Time to pick up the pieces and...
You know, and move on, I suppose.

621
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:43,900
Speaking of picking up the pieces?

622
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:50,610
Victor? Where are you going?

623
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:58,620
Miss Victoria, we must leave
for the church now.

624
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:02,480
Yesterday I thought my wedding
would be happy.

625
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:06,680
Now I feel like I'm caught
in the tide, pulled out to sea.

626
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:10,560
The sea leads to many places, dearie.

627
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:14,990
Maybe you'll land somewhere better.

628
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:25,370
With this candle, I will light
your way in darkness.

629
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:37,090
With this ring,
I ask you to be mine.

630
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:45,490
I now pronounce you man and wife.

631
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,070
Oh, oh, dear.

632
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,950
I'm too late.

633
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:12,680
Oh, Mrs. Plum, what am I to do?

634
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:17,090
He just walked off without saying
a word. Are all men like this?

635
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:20,130
Well, I'm afraid none of them
are very bright.

636
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:22,200
They get something stuck
in their heads...

637
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:24,930
...and you can't do a thing with them.

638
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:28,370
My dear, we have to talk.

639
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:32,880
- Let me tell her, please. Let me tell her.
- What?

640
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:36,110
There is a complication
with your marriage.

641
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,110
I don't understand.

642
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:42,720
The vows are binding
only until death do you part.

643
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,390
What are you saying?

644
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:47,860
Death has already parted you.

645
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,930
If he finds out, he'll leave.

646
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,120
There must be something you can do.

647
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,070
Well, there is one way.

648
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,140
Oh, please, please, let me tell her.

649
00:55:58,310 --> 00:56:01,330
It requires the greatest sacrifice.

650
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:05,310
- Go on, get to the good part.
- What is it?

651
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,180
- We have to kill him!
- What?

652
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:13,080
Victor would have to give up
the life he had forever.

653
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:17,320
He would need to repeat his vows
in the land of the living...

654
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:20,760
...and drink from the wine of ages.

655
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,860
Poison!

656
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:26,260
This would stop his heart forever.

657
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:29,700
Only then would he be free
to give it to you.

658
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:35,330
I could never ask him.

659
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:39,610
You don't have to.

660
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:43,410
I'll do it.

661
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:46,790
My boy, if you choose this path...

662
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:49,820
...you may never return
to the world above.

663
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,550
Do you understand?

664
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,960
I do.

665
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:00,200
Gather round. Gather round, everybody.

666
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:06,500
We've decided to do this thing properly.

667
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:09,070
So grab what you can and follow us.

668
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,800
We're moving this wedding party upstairs.

669
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:16,140
Upstairs? I didn't know
we had an upstairs.

670
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,880
- Sounds creepy.
- Let's go!

671
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:22,380
A wedding, a wedding
We're going to have a wedding

672
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,220
Hold on, Victor.

673
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,590
You can't get married looking like that.

674
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:34,060
The spiders think you're very cute
But goodness knows you need a suit

675
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:38,100
But have no fears, we're quite adept
We'll have you looking lovely, lovely, lovely

676
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:40,640
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely yet

677
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:44,640
A little stitch, a little tuck
Some tender loving care

678
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:47,940
A little thread will fix you up
And we've got plenty as you see

679
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:51,480
And personally guarantee
Our quality repairs

680
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:55,090
A little here, I'll fix the mess
We're going to do our very best

681
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:57,850
When everybody sees you
They will all be quite impressed

682
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:01,930
They will all be quite impressed

683
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,790
A wedding, we're going to have

684
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:07,030
A wedding cake is no mistake
It must be quite sublime

685
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,960
- We're missing something
- Try some dust

686
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:10,470
I wish I had more time

687
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,540
Perhaps there's something I can do
These bones might help a bit

688
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:15,540
- Oh, my nose.
- Sorry.

689
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:16,970
Wait a minute, that's it

690
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,540
- A little of that
- A little of this

691
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:20,410
The perfect cake is hard to miss

692
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:22,880
A wedding, a wedding
We're going to have

693
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:24,350
A wedding

694
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,150
Huzzah, huzzah

695
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,850
We're going to have a wedding
A wedding

696
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:35,290
Let's all give out a cheer
'Cause the bride is getting married today

697
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,500
One thing you can surely say
Is we will stand beside

698
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:42,570
Until the end we will defend
Our one and only bride

699
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:45,930
Our bride-to-be, our bride-to-be
Our lovely Corpse Bride

700
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:47,900
Huzzah! Hooray! Huzzah! Hooray!

701
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:52,310
Our bride is getting married today

702
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,510
- Oh, there she is.
- Here she comes.

703
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:03,380
Oh, oh, the bride is here

704
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,360
She's waited for this day
For many a year

705
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:11,690
For this day, for this day
Our hopes and our pride

706
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:18,070
The bride is here
Here comes the bride

707
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:22,230
Here comes the bride
Here comes the bride

708
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,410
For this day, for this day
Will last forever

709
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:30,380
And all of her friends
Will work together

710
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:34,250
To make it the perfect day
She's always dreamed

711
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:41,660
Our hopes and our pride
Our bride, our lovely bride

712
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:45,060
We're going to have a party
Like nobody's ever seen

713
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:48,930
The living in the land above
Will not know where they've been

714
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:55,740
The land above
The party of the bride

715
00:59:56,580 --> 01:00:02,380
Here comes the bride
On this glorious day of days

716
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:07,280
Up to the land of the living

717
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:15,260
To celebrate

718
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:20,190
Oh, dear.

719
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:35,050
Quiet down now, everyone.

720
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:41,020
Thank you.

721
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:46,550
Elegant, cultured, radiant.

722
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:49,960
Victoria has found a husband...

723
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:54,300
...with all these qualities and more.

724
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:57,060
Serendipity brought us together...

725
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:02,540
...and no force on earth
could tear us apart.

726
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:25,400
There's an eye in me soup.

727
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:35,900
Oh, sorry.

728
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:44,180
Fetch me musket!

729
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:46,480
Fetch your own musket. I'm off!

730
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:48,880
Coming through. Coming through.

731
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:56,890
Excuse me, you don't know me,
but I used to live in your dead mother.

732
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,830
Hey, hold on there.

733
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:03,860
I love a woman with meat on her bones.

734
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:07,670
Finis, who invited these people?

735
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,740
They must be from your side
of the family.

736
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:12,170
Certainly not.

737
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:16,310
Why, if my Grandfather Everglot could
see this, he'd be turning in his grave.

738
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,420
Finis.

739
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,120
Where do you keep the spirits?

740
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,130
In other news, the dead walk the earth!

741
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:43,570
Get back! Don't try
and sneak up on me!

742
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:45,210
Get back!

743
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:48,410
I'll give you such a wallop.

744
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:01,220
No.

745
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,760
Yeah.

746
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,040
Grandpa?

747
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:24,170
- Bounder!
- Sweetie pie.

748
01:03:24,350 --> 01:03:25,780
- Monster.
- Buttercup.

749
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:27,750
- Cad!
- Gertrude!

750
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:29,750
Alfred?

751
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:34,330
You've been dead for 15 years.

752
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:38,360
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.

753
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:40,300
Ethel!

754
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,440
Wait. That's it.

755
01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:56,010
We're going to take whatever money
we can and get out of here.

756
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:58,620
Money? What money?

757
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:01,150
Your dowry. It's my right!

758
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,310
But my parents don't have any money.

759
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:08,190
It's my marriage to you that will
save them from the poorhouse.

760
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,460
Th... The poorhouse?

761
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:14,770
You're lying. It isn't true.
Tell me that you're lying!

762
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:18,740
Did things not go according
to your plan, Lord Barkis?

763
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:23,710
Well, perhaps in disappointment
we are perfectly matched.

764
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:45,330
Be gone, ye demons from hell!

765
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:49,560
Back to the void
from whence you came!

766
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:51,530
You shall not enter here.

767
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:54,270
Back, back!

768
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,670
Keep it down, we're in a church.

769
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,740
Evening.

770
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:37,550
Dearly beloved and departed...

771
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:43,420
...we are gathered here today to join
this man and this corpse in marriage.

772
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,730
Victor?

773
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:52,160
Living first.

774
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:55,790
With this hand...

775
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:59,060
...I will lift your sorrows.

776
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:02,940
Your cup will never empty...

777
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,470
...for I will be your wine.

778
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:07,640
Now you.

779
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:14,880
With this hand...

780
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:17,350
...I will lift your sorrows.

781
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:22,020
Your cup will never empty.

782
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,820
For I will be...

783
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,130
I will be...

784
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,670
Go on, my dear.

785
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,040
Your cup...

786
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,810
...will never empty...

787
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:45,950
...for I will be...

788
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:50,280
I will be your wine.

789
01:06:54,930 --> 01:06:56,520
She's having second thoughts.

790
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:00,730
I can't.

791
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,100
What's wrong?

792
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,200
This is wrong.

793
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,530
I was a bride.

794
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:12,600
My dreams were taken from me.

795
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:15,040
Well, now...

796
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:18,610
Now I've stolen them
from someone else.

797
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:21,840
I love you, Victor.

798
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:25,520
But you're not mine.

799
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:32,160
Victoria!

800
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:50,110
Oh, how touching.

801
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:53,080
I always cry at weddings.

802
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:58,720
Our young lovers together at last.

803
01:07:58,890 --> 01:08:02,850
Surely now they can live
happily ever after.

804
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:05,520
But you forget...

805
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:07,830
...she's still my wife!

806
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,630
I'll not leave here empty-handed!

807
01:08:12,010 --> 01:08:13,170
You?

808
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:17,580
Emily?

809
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:18,940
You!

810
01:08:19,110 --> 01:08:22,100
But... But... I left you.

811
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:25,010
For dead.

812
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:27,650
This woman is obviously delusional!

813
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:38,630
Sorry to cut things short,
but we must be on our way.

814
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,170
Take your hands off her.

815
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:44,970
Do I have to kill you too?

816
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:51,370
Victor, catch!

817
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:53,500
Sorry.

818
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:10,490
I say, you're not playing fair, sir.

819
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:54,240
Touch�, my dear.

820
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,170
Get out.

821
01:09:56,910 --> 01:09:59,710
Oh, I'm leaving.

822
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:07,210
But first a toast. To Emily.

823
01:10:07,390 --> 01:10:11,820
Always the bridesmaid, never the bride.

824
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:13,950
Tell me, my dear...

825
01:10:14,130 --> 01:10:18,190
...can a heart still break
once it's stopped beating?

826
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,670
Let me at him! Let me at him!

827
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,390
- No, don't hold me back.
- Wait.

828
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:28,300
We must abide by their rules.

829
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:31,670
We are amongst the living.

830
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:33,710
Well said.

831
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:51,600
Not anymore.

832
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:58,040
Yep, you're right. He's all yours.

833
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:11,440
New arrival.

834
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:22,080
Oh, Victor,
I never thought I'd see you again.

835
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:30,930
Wait.

836
01:11:31,710 --> 01:11:33,940
I made a promise.

837
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,240
You kept your promise.

838
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,050
You set me free.

839
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:55,920
Now I can do the same for you.
