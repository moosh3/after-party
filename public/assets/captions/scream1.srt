- Mmm, no.

- You never told me your name.
- Why do you want to know my name?

- Come on. It'll be fun.

- Please.
- Movie trivia.

- Don't do this. I can't.

00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:41,777
- Name the killer in Halloween.
- No.

Come on!
It's your favorite scary movie, remember?

130
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:47,397
He had a white mask,
he stalked the babysitters.

I don't know.

- No, please.

Yes! Very good.

- No!

But you're doing so well.
We can't stop now.

00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:13,768

Jason! Jason! Jason!

143
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:26,447
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.

144
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,283
No, it's not!
No, it's not. It was Jason.

145

Afraid not. No way.

Listen, it was Jason.
I saw that movie 20 goddamn times!

147
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:39,293
Then you should know Jason's mother,
Mrs. Voorhees, was the original killer.

148

Jason didn't show up until the sequel.

I'm afraid that was a wrong answer.

There are two main doors to your house—
a front door and the patio doors.

Have to be, all the shit she's been through.

518
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:16,709
[Billy Screaming]
Sid!

519
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:19,545
Well, we're seein'
a lot of you today.

520
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:22,507
You gonna be able to come down to the station
and answer a few questions, Sid?

521
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,050
Oh, shit. Sidney!

522
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:26,302
God, Sid. I'm so sorry I was late.
Are you all right?

523
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:28,304
Tatum, you can't be here.
This is an official crime scene.

524
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:29,889
- It's okay.
- [Sighs]

525
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:32,392
Her dad's out of town, all right?
She's staying with us tonight.

526
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:35,395
- Does Mom know?
- Yes, doofus.

527
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,855
- Let's get you out of here.
- [Woman] She'll be okay.

528
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,107
- Thanks.
- Come on, Sid.

529
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,691
You won't believe this.

530
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:46,322
- [Man] Right there.
- Creepy, huh?

531
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:56,249
- [Man] Break this up.
- I'll be damned.

532
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:57,834
- What?
- Jesus! The camera, hurry!

533
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:00,044
My name isn't Jesus.

534
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,840
Sidney, is that you in there?

535
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,842
Excuse me.
Is that Sidney Prescott they took away?

536
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:07,802
- I'm not talking to you.
- What happened to her?

537
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:09,387
None of your damn business.

538
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,264
I heard something about a costume.
Is that true?

539
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:13,641
Can you tell me anything?

540
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:17,019
Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass.
Leave Sid alone.

541
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:19,772
Where's she goin'?

542
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:23,776
- Look. Kenny?
- Yeah?

543
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,446
I know that you're about
50 pounds overweight,

544
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:28,072
but when I say “hurry,”

545
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:33,202
please interpret that as
“move your fat, tub-of-lard ass now!”

546
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:34,871
[Snorts]

547
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:38,082
Did you find him?

548
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,585
You sure it was the Hilton?

549
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:42,670
At the airport.

550
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:43,754
[Typing]

551
00:32:44,422 --> 00:32:47,550
He's not registered there.
[Sighs]

552
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,135
Could he have stayed somewhere else?

553
00:32:50,261 --> 00:32:53,222
I don't know. I guess.
[Sniffles]

554
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,767
Don't worry, Sid.
We'll find him.

555
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,061
[Man] Dewey, they got
that mask in.

556
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:03,191
I'll be right back.

557
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:10,323
[Handcuffs Rattling]

558
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:12,116
Let me ask you this.

559
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,410
What are you doing
with a cellular telephone, son?

560
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:17,205
Everybody's got one, Sheriff.

561
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:20,082
I didn't make those calls, I swear.

562
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,001
Why don't you check the phone bill,
for Christ's sake?

563
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:24,587
Call Vital Phone Comp.
They got the records of every number dialed.

564
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,756
Thanks, Hank. We're on top of it.

565
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:30,301
What were you doing
over at Sidney's house tonight?

566
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:32,887
I wanted to see her. That's all.

567
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:36,724
And last night? Sidney said you crawled
through her window last night too.

568
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:38,351
You went out last night?

569
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:40,102
[Stammers]

570
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:43,773
I was watching TV.
I got bored. I decided to go for a ride.

571
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,650
Did you happen to ride by
Casey Becker's house?

572
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:48,528
No. No, I didn't.

573
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:50,780
Sheriff, I didn't kill anybody,

574
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:59,247
We're gonna have to hold you, son,
till we get those phone records.

575
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,085
This is crazy.

576
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:08,089
You know that? I didn't do it.

577
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:19,016
[Chattering]

578
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,686
[Woman]
Camera Two? Okay.

579
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:23,312
Are there any more doughnuts in there?

580
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:26,482
- Move it, Kenny.
- They're not lettin' anybody in.

581
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:28,067
I'm not just anyone.

582
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,569
[Mutters]
More like a bitch goddess.

583
00:34:29,694 --> 00:34:31,362
- Kenny, are we on?
- Yeah, go.

584
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:34,073
Hi. Gale Weathers reporting live
from the Woodsboro police station,

585
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:36,450
where we hope to get a glimpse
of Sidney Prescott.

586
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:38,035
[Man]
Hey. Watch it, lady.

587
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,246
Hey, watch the hand!
You know who you're dealing with here?

588
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:43,249
Tell 'em. Come on, Dad.
Tell 'em!

589
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:45,585
- Just wait for the lawyer, Billy.
- Sidney!

590
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,045
- Sidney, come on. You know me.
- [Deputy] Come on, come on.

591
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:50,798
- Sidney, look at me!
- [Deputy] Don't give us any trouble.

592
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:52,008
[Billy]
Come on!

593
00:34:57,597 --> 00:34:58,889
Sid.

594
00:34:58,973 --> 00:35:01,475
We're gonna get you
out of here, okay? You okay?

595
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:06,397
[Sighs] They sell this costume
at every five-and-dime in the state.

596
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:08,858
There's no way to track the purchase.

597
00:35:10,443 --> 00:35:12,028
What about that cellular phone bill?

598
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:16,449
We're pulling Loomis's account.
We won't know anything until the morning.

599
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:18,367
[Tatum]
Oh, come on!

600
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,497
You think he did it?

601
00:35:20,522 --> 00:35:23,539
Twenty years ago,
I would've said, “Not a chance.”

602
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:25,374
But these kids today—

603
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,002
[Snorts]
Damned if I know.

604
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:31,297
- Hey, Dewey, can we go now?
- Hold on a second.

605
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,716
- Goddamn it, Dewey!
- [Deputies Mocking]

606
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:37,428
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this
badge, you treat me like a man of the law.

607
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:40,723
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy,
but we're ready to go. Now, okay?

608
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:42,850
- [Man] Whoa.
- [Laughter]

609
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:45,895
Take 'em out the back way.
Avoid that circus out there.

610
00:35:47,355 --> 00:35:48,981
- Come on.
- Don't touch me!

611
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:52,943
- He's my superior!
- Janitors are your superior.

612
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:57,740
Let's get back to work!

613
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:05,706
Isn't there a back way
out of this building?

614
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,583
Yeah. Down that alley, I think.

615
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:14,507
You guys stay here.
I'm gonna get the car.

616
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,092
Don't move.
Don't make a sound.

617
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:20,262
[Gale]
There she is. Sidney!

618
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:24,475
Hi. Some night.
What happened? Are you all right?

619
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:26,644
She's not answering any questions,
all right? Just leave us alone.

620
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:29,438
No. No, Tatum, it's okay.
She's just doin' her job, right, Gale?

621
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:32,942
- Yes, that's right.
- So, how's the book?

622
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:34,985
Well, it'll be out later this year.

623
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:37,363
Oh. I'll look for it.

624
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:38,989
I'll send you a copy.

625
00:36:39,073 --> 00:36:40,324
[Grunts]

626
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:41,909
[Kenny]
Ooh! Jeez.

627
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:45,037
- [Kenny] Nice shot.
- [Gale] Bitch.

628
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:48,457
- No, I mean, camera shot.
- Where'd you learn to punch like that?

629
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:51,377
God, I loved it. “I'll send you a copy.”

630
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,754
Bam! Bitch went down.

631
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:57,633
“I'll send you a copy.”
Bam! Sid, superbitch!

632
00:36:57,717 --> 00:36:59,468
You are so cool.

633
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:01,387
Thought you might
want some ice for that right hook.

634
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:03,639
Thanks.

635
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:07,476
I'll be right next door.
Try to get some sleep.

636
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,811
Yeah, yeah.

637
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:18,195
Do you really think Billy did it?
[Telephone Rings]

638
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:19,864
He was there, Tatum.

639
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:24,535
He was destined to have a flaw.
I knew he was too perfect.

[Knocking]

641
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:28,456
- Telephone, honey.
- Who is it?

642
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:30,750
- It's for Sid.
- My dad?

643
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:33,711
- I don't think so.
- [Tatum] Take a message.

644
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:35,796
No. I'll get it.

645
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,427
How's she doin'?

646
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:46,098
Hello?

647

[Male Voice]
Hello, Sidney.

648
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,269
No!

649
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,730
Poor Billy boyfriend.

650
00:37:52,813 --> 00:37:55,357
An innocent guy doesn't stand
a chance with you.

651
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:56,942
Leave me alone!

652
00:37:57,026 --> 00:38:00,196
Looks like you fingered the wrong
guy... again!

653
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:01,238
[Knocking]
Who are you?

654
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:02,448
- Dewey!
- Hang up, Sid.

655
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:05,659
Don't worry.
You'll find out soon enough.

656
00:38:05,743 --> 00:38:07,453
- I promise.
- [Mother] Dewey!

[Dial Tone]

658
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:11,248
[Dewey]
What?

659
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:15,878
- [Tatum] “What?”
- What?

660
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,219
Hello?

661
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:37,858
[Man] Sidney Prescott, who escaped
a vicious attack last night,

662
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:41,403
is the daughter of Maureen Prescott,
who was brutally killed last year...

663
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:44,406
when convicted murderer
Cotton Weary broke into their home...

664
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,451
and savagely raped
and tortured the deceased.

665
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:50,871
Cotton Weary is currently awaiting appeal
for the death sentence handed down...

666
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:53,707
after the young Sidney
testified against him.

667
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:56,377
She was the key witness
in the state's case against the—

668
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,257
It's never gonna stop, is it?

669
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,051
Billy was released.

670
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:08,639
His cellular bill was clean.
He didn't make those calls.

671
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:11,851
We're checkin'
every cellular account in the county.

672
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:15,062
Any calls made to you or Casey Becker
are being cross-referenced.

673
00:39:16,397 --> 00:39:18,440
It's gonna take some time,
but we'll find him.

674
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:21,360
You okay?

675
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:26,782
[Siren Wails]

676
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:41,005
Don't worry, Sid.
It's school. You'll be safe here.

677
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:42,882
So how does it feel
to be almost brutally butchered?

678
00:39:42,965 --> 00:39:44,466
Hey, now leave her alone.

679
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,385
People want to know!
They have a right to know!

680
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:48,178
- [Dewey] Leave her alone.
- How does it feel?

681
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:50,973
[Dewey] She just wants to get an education.
Turn that thing off.

682
00:39:52,975 --> 00:39:53,976
What?

683
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:56,979
[Mouthing Words]
