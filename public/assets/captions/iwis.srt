{\an8}Um, everyone really loved
the last dating video I did,

00:02:38,463 --> 00:02:40,463

And I know that's scary.
I know it feels really hard,

I know sometimes it's scary to take risks,

31

you can do something different.

You can be spontaneous.

33
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,796

I wanted to do it.

that's totally fine.

You want me to make a whole production

a stupid idea, but here we are. I'm in it.

Well, if you didn't wanna do it...

If you didn't wanna do it,
you didn't have to put the thing on.

we should go to the wedding.

00:09:33,796 --> 00:09:36,005
- [screams]
- [Cyrus] What? What? What?

170
00:09:36,921 --> 00:09:39,088
- A bird just flew in my face.
- [Cyrus] What?

171
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,546
- A fucking bird just flew in my face.
- You're gonna be fine, I think.

172
00:09:42,546 --> 00:09:45,963
I think you're gonna be all right. Right?
Come on, honey.

173
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:49,505
It's gonna be fun.

174
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,005
See everybody, you know?
You know, it's cool.

175
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:56,588
It's good that we're here, you know?
It's... It's, like, good.

176
00:09:56,588 --> 00:09:58,838
- Is that what you're always doing?
- What?

177
00:09:59,338 --> 00:10:00,421
When I'm on a run?

178
00:10:02,463 --> 00:10:04,005
Why are you talking about that now?

179
00:10:04,005 --> 00:10:07,338
I don't know. Is it your designated time
for you to just relieve stress?

180
00:10:07,338 --> 00:10:08,505
- Hey!
- Hey, man!

181
00:10:08,505 --> 00:10:09,713
Oh shit!

182
00:10:09,713 --> 00:10:11,505
Shelby Beautiful in the house.

183
00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:13,921
- Come here, girl. What's up? [squeals]
- Hi--

184
00:10:13,921 --> 00:10:16,505
It's good to see you.
Damn, you smell good. Fuck, that's good.

185
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:17,880
[Cyrus] Hey, man.

186
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,380
How's it going?

187
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,463
Yo, y'all believe it?
Reuben's getting fucking hitched! Oh shit!

188
00:10:23,463 --> 00:10:26,213
[Cyrus] Crazy. I can't believe it.
How's it going? What's going on?

189
00:10:26,213 --> 00:10:28,005
Yeah, it's going really good for me.

190
00:10:28,005 --> 00:10:30,713
I've been fucking running the charts.
Know what I'm talking about?

191
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,255
I'm talking, like, leveling up,

192
00:10:32,255 --> 00:10:34,671
turn over a new leaf,
TED Talk kind of shit,

193
00:10:34,671 --> 00:10:36,421
like, physically, mentally, emotionally...

194
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:38,796
- Shelby Jansen. [laughs]
- ...spiritually. [laughs]

195
00:10:38,796 --> 00:10:41,880
- Hi. I missed you so much. Wow.
- [man] What's up, bro? You good?

196
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,671
- [Cyrus] Yeah, things are--
- [man] Cool.

197
00:10:43,671 --> 00:10:45,546
- I love your flower tattoo.
- Thank you.

198
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:48,380
- It's a lotus flower. I got it in Bali.
- I'm getting some tunes bombing.

199
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,796
It represents rebirth. Hi! Hi!

200
00:10:50,796 --> 00:10:53,005
- I went on a Buddhist retreat.
- These are incredible.

201
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:55,130
- Wow, how are you guys?
- We're pretty good.

202
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,088
- Wow, you guys make a beautiful couple.
- [Nikki] Oh my God!

203
00:10:58,088 --> 00:11:00,963
- Hi!
- Hi! Hi.

204
00:11:00,963 --> 00:11:02,338
[Nikki] You look so cute.

205
00:11:02,338 --> 00:11:05,255
Oh, thank you. I love your top.
It looks really...

206
00:11:05,255 --> 00:11:06,796
- [Cyrus] Nikki.
- [Nikki] Thank you.

207
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:09,505
- Hey.
- [laughing] Hey. What's going on?

208
00:11:09,505 --> 00:11:12,046
Oh my God. Congratulations.

209
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,088
Oh, thank... On what?

210
00:11:14,796 --> 00:11:16,546
- You got married.
- Oh, I--

211
00:11:16,546 --> 00:11:18,755
- What? When?
- [Cyrus] Oh no. No, we didn't get married.

212
00:11:18,755 --> 00:11:20,921
- Who am I thinking of?
- A different person.

213
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:22,046
Is that peanut butter?

214
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:23,796
You partner with a peanut butter brand.

215
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:26,213
No, cashew butter.
I'm allergic to peanut butter. You know.

216
00:11:26,213 --> 00:11:27,505
[woman 1] Oh my God.

217
00:11:27,505 --> 00:11:29,671
Are you partnering
with a cashew butter brand?

218
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:31,463
What? What?

219
00:11:31,463 --> 00:11:33,796
- Oh my--
- Oh my God!

220
00:11:33,796 --> 00:11:35,505
[woman 2] Holy fuck, Dennis!

221
00:11:35,505 --> 00:11:36,880
[loud music playing]

222
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,088
Wait, did you guys get married?

223
00:11:39,088 --> 00:11:41,046
- Did Nikki already ask you?
- They're not--

224
00:11:41,046 --> 00:11:43,255
- Did you ask that?
- [woman 2] Brooke's had a head start.

225
00:11:43,255 --> 00:11:46,546
Oh my God. I'm obsessed
with your Instagram. It's so good.

226
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:48,255
- How are you?
- [Cyrus] Yeah, things--

227
00:11:48,255 --> 00:11:50,630
- A bird flew in my face.
- What?

228
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,755
- Dude!
- Oh my God.

229
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:53,880
- Are you okay?
- Right now? Did it hurt?

230
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,421
- [Brooke] So are you jealous of Sophia?
- Ow!

231
00:11:56,421 --> 00:12:00,046
- [Shelby] No. Why, are you?
- [Brooke] I mean, yeah, obviously.

232
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:03,130
- [Shelby] Uh, no.
- [Brooke] Oh. Oh, no, I...

233
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:05,338
[Cyrus] Hey, man.

234
00:12:06,588 --> 00:12:08,588
[laughing]

235
00:12:09,088 --> 00:12:12,630
Hey, man!
Cyrus the Vyrus, baby. Come here.

236
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,338
Come here. [laughing]

237
00:12:15,338 --> 00:12:17,338
- I missed you, man.
- I missed you too.

238
00:12:17,338 --> 00:12:18,921
- I missed you too.
- Yeah, man.

239
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:20,921
Man, it's crazy you still have this place.

240
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:23,213
Yeah, man,
I got a free wedding venue out of it, so...

241
00:12:23,213 --> 00:12:26,755
What the heck is this?
I forgot about this thing. Look at this.

242
00:12:26,755 --> 00:12:29,005
Man, yeah. I'm good, man. I'm...

243
00:12:29,505 --> 00:12:31,588
It's happening, man. We're here. It's...

244
00:12:31,588 --> 00:12:33,588
- You're getting married.
- Yeah, apparently.

245
00:12:33,588 --> 00:12:36,338
- How are you feeling about it?
- I'm good, man.

246
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,546
- How you been, man?
- I'm good. I'm good, man.

247
00:12:38,546 --> 00:12:39,505
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

248
00:12:39,505 --> 00:12:42,380
Wait, did I hear you invited Forbes?

249
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,796
I did, yeah.

250
00:12:45,338 --> 00:12:46,380
Is he coming?

251
00:12:48,171 --> 00:12:49,463
Never heard back, man.

252
00:12:49,463 --> 00:12:51,296
Wait, Forbes is coming?

253
00:12:51,296 --> 00:12:54,380
[Brooke shushing] All that stuff
that went down with Dennis and Forbes?

254
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,296
- She wasn't there.
- Wait, you weren't there?

255
00:12:56,296 --> 00:12:57,880
[Shelby] Where, at the party?

256
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,421
- She wasn't there.
- Wait.

257
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:02,588
What do you remember about Forbes?

258
00:13:02,588 --> 00:13:04,046
[air whooshing]

259
00:13:04,046 --> 00:13:05,421
[silence]

260
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:06,963
[Shelby] I loved Forbes.

261
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,380
{\an8}He got the freshman grant.
He was a genius.

262
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,088
{\an8}- [Brooke] Yeah, but he was weird.
- [Shelby] Because he put on game nights?

263
00:13:14,088 --> 00:13:15,546
[woman] People called him Game Boy.

264
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:17,005
[Brooke] People called him Game Boy

265
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,546
because he'd get fucked up and crazy.
He was wild.

266
00:13:19,546 --> 00:13:23,171
- [woman] Dennis was wild, too, though.
- [Brooke] Right, but Forbes had a temper.

267
00:13:23,171 --> 00:13:25,421
[woman] So cut to the night
of Dennis's birthday party.

268
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:28,171
- [Brooke] Reuben's birthday party.
- [woman] At the Fletcher House.

269
00:13:28,171 --> 00:13:30,005
[Shelby] Oh,
the night Forbes got expelled?

270
00:13:30,005 --> 00:13:33,171
- [Brooke] Yeah. Forbes's cousin was there.
- [woman] Sister. It was his sister.

271
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:34,921
[Brooke] Who was still in high school.

272
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:36,505
{\an8}[woman] Yeah. Janice, right?

273
00:13:36,505 --> 00:13:37,505
{\an8}[Brooke] No. Beatrice.

274
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:40,671
{\an8}[woman] Right.
She was literally obsessed with Dennis.

275
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:43,755
[Brooke] Telling everyone that her and him
were boyfriend and girlfriend.

276
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:45,671
[woman] Yeah, but it was extra dramatic

277
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:48,463
because that was
when Dennis and Nikki had started talking.

278
00:13:48,463 --> 00:13:49,880
[Brooke] No, they were together.

279
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,588
- [woman] Were they?
- [Brooke] Yeah.

280
00:13:51,588 --> 00:13:53,671
Beatrice sees them together
and starts freaking out.

281
00:13:53,671 --> 00:13:54,755
Starts attacking Nikki.

282
00:13:54,755 --> 00:13:58,505
[woman] It escalates to the point where
Forbes and Dennis got into a huge fight.

283
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:01,213
[Brooke] Yeah, like a fistfight.
So then, the cops showed up.

284
00:14:01,213 --> 00:14:02,380
Dennis gets in trouble.

285
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,588
Gets escorted out by the police
for fighting.

286
00:14:04,588 --> 00:14:05,671
[Shelby] Wait, what?

287
00:14:05,671 --> 00:14:07,671
[Brooke]
But then Forbes ended up getting expelled

288
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:10,296
because he brought
his high school-aged sister to the party,

289
00:14:10,296 --> 00:14:12,421
gave her alcohol
and got her totally plastered.

290
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:15,796
[woman] Yeah. And she ends up
being sent away to a mental hospital.

291
00:14:15,796 --> 00:14:18,130
- [Shelby] That's why Forbes got expelled?
- [Brooke] Yeah.

292
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,963
[Shelby] I thought it was
because he was drunk

293
00:14:19,963 --> 00:14:21,796
and broke a bunch of stuff or something.

294
00:14:21,796 --> 00:14:24,255
[woman] No, it was
because he got his sister super drunk

295
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,005
and started all this epic drama.

296
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:29,421
[Brooke] Then, Forbes went to California,
started working as a tech guy,

297
00:14:29,421 --> 00:14:31,755
joined some tech company,
doing tech company shit.

298
00:14:33,921 --> 00:14:35,463
No one's heard from him since.

299
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:38,838
[indistinct chatter and upbeat music]

300
00:14:38,838 --> 00:14:42,130
Hasn't it been about eight years?
I'm sure that Dennis has probably--

301
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,963
Hey, quit talking shit.
It's too early for all that.

302
00:14:44,963 --> 00:14:47,171
- When would be a good time?
- [Dennis] After we eat.

303
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:49,505
We have wine, bitches.

304
00:14:49,505 --> 00:14:51,880
["What's A Matter Baby
(Is It Hurting You)" playing]

305
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,796
Okay.

306
00:14:54,421 --> 00:14:58,005
So if you look at it normally,
it's like this one thing, right?

307
00:14:58,005 --> 00:15:00,921
But then if you look at it
through a colored lens,

308
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:02,880
you see something different inside.

309
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,380
- [Dennis] Oh shit.
- Yeah.

310
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,921
- [woman] Dude, that's...
- Wow.

311
00:15:05,921 --> 00:15:07,713
[woman] Let me show you my favorite.

312
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:10,046
- Look.
- [Cyrus] Oh, you drew this?

313
00:15:10,046 --> 00:15:13,713
Wow, you can, like, feel the loneliness
radiating off the page.

314
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:17,463
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, basically,
it's inspired by RGB printing,

315
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:21,630
or, like, every time that you look at
a screen, you see all these colors, right?

316
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:26,130
But really, every single color you see
is just a blend of red and green and blue.

317
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,546
So really, every color

318
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:30,338
is actually just three colors
hidden inside of it.

319
00:15:30,338 --> 00:15:31,838
That's so cool.

320
00:15:31,838 --> 00:15:34,130
Can we talk about how crazy it is
you're still single?

321
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,421
- [woman] Yeah.
- [Brooke] Me?

322
00:15:35,421 --> 00:15:36,380
[Nikki] Mm-hmm.

323
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,338
[Brooke laughs] I mean, I...

324
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,046
- I don't know.
- [Nikki] Oh my God.

325
00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:42,671
You're the perfect blend
of artsy and exotic. It's like catnip.

326
00:15:42,671 --> 00:15:43,588
I mean...

327
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:46,130
Yo, Nikki, you should tag her
in one of your Instagram Stories

328
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,046
so she can cherry-pick
one of your 8 billion followers.

329
00:15:49,046 --> 00:15:52,755
- [woman] How many followers do you have?
- [Nikki] I mean, I don't look at it.

330
00:15:52,755 --> 00:15:55,588
Oh, bullshit. You know exactly
how many followers you have.

331
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:58,463
[Nikki] Why don't you tell me,
seeing as you look at my Stories.

332
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,421
- [Dennis] I don't fuck with Instagram.
- [Nikki] I know you have Instagram.

333
00:16:01,421 --> 00:16:04,546
- You have two Instagrams.
- [Dennis] Well, I get on there to...

- [Dennis] "Who wants to see my Inst--"
- [Nikki] No one wants to hear it.

337
00:16:20,671 --> 00:16:22,505
All right, all right, all right.

338
00:16:22,505 --> 00:16:26,505
Speaking of shit no one wants to hear,
I'd like to propose a toast.

[whooping and drum roll]

340
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:30,671
- [Brooke] Let's do it.
- [Dennis] Man of the house!

341
00:16:30,671 --> 00:16:31,588
All right.

[exhales]

343
00:16:33,963 --> 00:16:35,046

[music fades out]

345
00:16:36,421 --> 00:16:40,463
Eight fucking years ago, my mom died.

346
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:44,713
And, um... I had to come here, her house,

347
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:48,755
and decide what to do
with all of her work and shit and...

348

the worst weekend of my life.

But then all of you...

mm, mm, mm and Forbes,

352
00:17:00,338 --> 00:17:02,755
decided to come,
and it ended up being the best.

353
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:07,296
And I know you all agreed back then

354
00:17:07,296 --> 00:17:09,671
to come here the night
before my wedding and...

355
00:17:09,671 --> 00:17:10,755
[clears throat]

356
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:14,963
But when I, um, said I wanted
to spend this evening with you guys,

357
00:17:14,963 --> 00:17:18,380
I was, um, I was high as fuck
and I didn't really mean it.

358
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,671
So if you could all, you know?
Yeah, no, if you could all leave.

359
00:17:21,671 --> 00:17:23,755
Get the fuck out of here, you lightweight.

360
00:17:23,755 --> 00:17:25,796
Just do it, Reuben.
You were doing so good.

361
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:27,380
Finish your toast.

362
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,588
[Reuben] No, but, um, seriously...

363
00:17:33,505 --> 00:17:35,838
I want this to be a special fucking night.

364
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:39,546
And... [exhales]

365
00:17:39,546 --> 00:17:40,963
...being here with you...

366
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,713
is like being with my people, you know?

367
00:17:50,421 --> 00:17:52,963
Sometimes, I feel like I can't...

368
00:17:55,546 --> 00:17:57,255
- Um...

[Reuben laughs]

372

00:19:12,213 --> 00:19:13,796
Uh, sorry, I was just...

How's it going, man?

00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:16,005
Yeah.

385
00:19:16,671 --> 00:19:17,505
Really good.

00:19:18,005 --> 00:19:18,838
Yeah?

387
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,671
Are you and Shelby, um...?

Oh.

390
00:19:26,796 --> 00:19:28,213
I'm sorry. I just...

391
00:19:28,213 --> 00:19:30,921
Everybody has been asking
the second I came in the door,

392
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,963
and she's kind of been on me,

393
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,588
and I'm just... I'm not ready.

394
00:19:36,546 --> 00:19:38,296
Everybody's kind of still...

395
00:19:38,296 --> 00:19:42,005
And she's always talking about,
like, having new experiences. Like...

396
00:19:42,505 --> 00:19:47,171
I don't know, like, last week it was, uh,
dance lessons, like, ballroom dancing.

397
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:48,630
Uh... [chuckling]

398
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,963
And, what, I'm gonna be,
like, some dance guy?

399
00:19:51,963 --> 00:19:54,838
And it's not even...
It's, like, just everything.

400
00:19:54,838 --> 00:19:57,630
It's, like, "Did you pick up the..."

401
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,005
And it's, like...
And there's some good part...

402
00:20:00,005 --> 00:20:03,255
But I guess it's about, like,
you know, deciding.

403
00:20:03,255 --> 00:20:06,005
You know?
But I'm not in a place, particularly,

404
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:09,296
where I feel like
I can totally do that at the moment.

405
00:20:09,296 --> 00:20:12,005
And... But I can't say that. Anyway, yeah...

[Reuben] Hey, is there someone
with the name Forbes in there?

413
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:28,421
[Forbes] There is.

414
00:20:28,421 --> 00:20:32,755
[Reuben sings] Well, I got a joint
with your name written on it.

415
00:20:32,755 --> 00:20:33,671
[Cyrus] Anyway.

416
00:20:33,671 --> 00:20:35,255
[Nikki] It's not all about brands.

417
00:20:35,255 --> 00:20:39,380
You know, there's a charity I work with
that brings relief to villages in Sudan.

418
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,630
Honestly, social media
is this amazing resource.

419
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,421
I don't think we really think of it
that way, but it's true.

420
00:20:44,421 --> 00:20:45,838
You know, it connects people.

421
00:20:45,838 --> 00:20:47,880
It can show people
what's going on in the world.

422
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,421
It's a vessel.
And that's so important, I think.

423
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:51,671
Mm. [inhales]

[Reuben] Thanks for making it out, man.

431
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,505
Of course. Wouldn't have missed it.

to meet the missus, really.

Oh, uh...

444
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:44,671
I don't know. I've just been
traveling the world and, uh, making paper.

[Reuben coughs]

446
00:21:46,713 --> 00:21:47,671
[Nikki] Sick.

447
00:21:47,671 --> 00:21:51,005
What, are you like an entrepreneur now
or something, bro? [laughs]

448
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:52,046
Is that, uh...

449
00:21:52,755 --> 00:21:54,338
Is that what's in the suitcase?

450
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,671
You had mentioned that we might be
playing some games tonight.

451
00:21:58,671 --> 00:22:01,755
- Do you still wanna play games?
- Yeah, I wanna play games tonight, man.

452
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:05,588
Yeah, and if you guys aren't ready
right now, I can put it away, and we can...

453
00:22:05,588 --> 00:22:08,046
- [woman] Dude, I'm down.
- I'm down to play a couple games.

- I'm perfectly faded right now.
- [Brooke] I wanna play. Yeah.

455
00:22:11,255 --> 00:22:15,630
Okay, so just, uh,
before I open this suitcase,

456
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:20,130
this is just some
"needs to stay in this room" type shit.

457
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,255
So, uh, no phones out or anything, okay?

458
00:22:23,255 --> 00:22:26,713
[Dennis coughs] Bro, that's like
telling Nikki not to breathe and shit.

459
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:29,338
[Nikki] Dennis,
you're just so funny all the time.

460
00:22:30,505 --> 00:22:31,421
Um...

461
00:22:32,171 --> 00:22:36,963
So my team and I have been working
on this thing for five years.

462
00:22:37,463 --> 00:22:38,421
Yeah...

463
00:22:38,421 --> 00:22:40,755
You know, I could explain
to you all what it is,

464
00:22:40,755 --> 00:22:43,546
but I think the best way
for you to understand

465
00:22:43,546 --> 00:22:46,088
is if you just try it yourself.

466
00:22:46,088 --> 00:22:48,171
[suspenseful music playing]

467
00:22:51,088 --> 00:22:51,921

[machine powering up]

469
00:23:06,213 --> 00:23:09,755

- [Nikki] Um...

470
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,088

471
00:23:12,755 --> 00:23:13,963
[Forbes] Shelby.

472
00:23:13,963 --> 00:23:15,046
[Dennis] What is this?

473
00:23:15,046 --> 00:23:17,130
[Forbes] Dennis. Nikki. Maya.

474
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:20,671
- [Maya] I was expecting like a board game.
- [Forbes] Brooke. Cyrus.

475
00:23:20,671 --> 00:23:21,880
And these are mine.

476
00:23:23,463 --> 00:23:26,088
Okay, so here we are.

477
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:30,255
So you just wanna take these electrodes

478
00:23:30,755 --> 00:23:34,880
and place them on your temples like so.

479
00:23:36,755 --> 00:23:38,088
[Dennis] Bro, you serious?

480
00:23:39,046 --> 00:23:40,671
[Forbes] Don't worry. I'm doing it too.

481
00:23:43,546 --> 00:23:45,130
[Dennis exhales] All right.

482
00:23:45,838 --> 00:23:46,921
[Nikki] Okay.

483
00:23:46,921 --> 00:23:47,963
[Cyrus] How does...

484
00:23:49,421 --> 00:23:50,546
How does it, like...

485
00:23:51,046 --> 00:23:52,963
[Forbes] It doesn't hurt at all, I swear.

486
00:23:55,838 --> 00:23:56,671
[Maya] Okay.

487
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,921
Wait, Forbes. What is that?

488
00:24:01,088 --> 00:24:04,296
It's just a 20-second experience.
That's it. I promise.

489
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,046
Okay, ready?

490
00:24:14,338 --> 00:24:18,255
[theatrically] And those were
the last words any of them heard.

491
00:24:18,255 --> 00:24:19,505
Damn.

492
00:24:19,505 --> 00:24:22,463
Dude, what if Forbes is
messing with the wires, but...

493
00:24:22,463 --> 00:24:25,088
...nothing actually ended up happening.

494
00:24:26,088 --> 00:24:28,130
Everybody, please keep your electrodes on.

495
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,755
- What the fuck?
- No.

496
00:24:29,755 --> 00:24:31,838
- Take a deep breath. It's okay.
- Cyrus?

497
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:33,505
- Yo, bro!
- Cyrus, what's happening?

- Can you please stop that?

838
00:42:42,713 --> 00:42:44,296
Just fucking stop!

839
00:42:44,296 --> 00:42:46,713

- [Forbes] Is that what I hear?

[Reuben] Are you sure everyone's
in the right spot?

841

00:42:50,213 --> 00:42:51,630
It's fine. It's ready.

- Okay, guys.
- [Forbes] Fucking hot.

845

Get ready to jump back
into your boring asshole bodies.

I'm feeling a little tired.

- [Nikki] No! Forbes, come on, no.
- [Reuben] What?

859

This is so fun. We wanna go again.

860
00:43:41,088 --> 00:43:42,838
Seriously, when you see yourself,

861
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:46,213
like, literally see yourself
from the outside, it's like--

862
00:43:46,213 --> 00:43:47,838
- More potential.
- Yeah, exactly.

863
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:51,505
When you look at someone and see
the potential they don't see. [moans]

864

- It's like addictive.
- [Forbes] Yeah.

865
00:43:53,546 --> 00:43:55,921
It's like there's no drug
that can compare with the high

866
00:43:55,921 --> 00:43:57,755
of being in someone else's body.

867
00:43:57,755 --> 00:43:58,671
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

868
00:43:58,671 --> 00:44:00,046
Each body you're going into

869
00:44:00,046 --> 00:44:02,421
is giving you another piece
of the human condition.

870
00:44:02,421 --> 00:44:03,588
[Brooke] Exactly. Yes!

871
00:44:03,588 --> 00:44:05,963
After a while,
you want to constantly switch.

872
00:44:05,963 --> 00:44:08,630
- [Nikki] Yeah.
- That's why you wanna constantly switch.

873
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:12,213
No, but, like, Forbes...
Like, this... Even this game is important.

874
00:44:12,213 --> 00:44:14,921
Like, playing this,
becoming a different ethnicity,

875
00:44:14,921 --> 00:44:17,380
could change people's world views.
Like, it's big stuff.

- Yeah.

Was there anything specific?

Was there anything in particular
that made it, like, extra fun for you or...

No. I... I just had fun.

- Yeah.

Wow, it was just fun. That's so fun.

- Yeah.
- Wow.

Good. Dude, when I was just in your body,

All that shit we said about that night,

for a headache is a new body.

has a headache and then...

to handle this little headache.

I feel like you
and I really got shafted last round.

We never even got
to get into character, you know?

946
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:30,463

you were in Forbes last round, so...

Oh really?

948
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:33,505
Yeah, you said "perfunctory."

949

Nobody says "perfunctory"
out loud in an actual sentence

950
00:47:36,796 --> 00:47:38,380
unless they're overcompensating.

at pretending to be someone else.

- All right, guys.

Oh, really, bro?
What are you trying to say?

Why'd you talk like you're in a rap video?

955
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:49,963
- Did you just say "rap video?"
- All right.

956

- All the time.

I'm just saying you get super mad
and you don't let anything go.

- And it's not healthy.
- It is healthy.

961

Letting shit go isn't healthy.

962
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,630
You never learn from it

963
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:07,255
and you let people take advantage of you
over and over, like the dental hygienist.

Oh my God!

965
00:48:08,255 --> 00:48:11,046
- That's a perfect example--
- What should I have said to her?

966
00:48:11,046 --> 00:48:14,213
I don't know.
Like, "Hey, what you did was wrong."

"It was fucking wrong
and you're a shitty person."

"You deserve to live
the rest of your miserable existence

00:48:22,255 --> 00:48:24,630
"So fuck on that, bitch."

971
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:29,130

so you can feel better?

to convince me to play,

981

you're questioning it?

- Okay, all right, okay.

Why don't we have a signal
so that we know whose body we are in?

987
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:11,130
Why?

988
00:49:12,713 --> 00:49:16,088
If they're... We're dealing...
I mean, if the technology...

989

If you're...

990

- There's an emergency--
- Yeah, okay, fine, fine.

991
00:49:20,921 --> 00:49:23,838
Okay. Maybe it's like... Wait, just...

992
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:26,380
- You... No, more...
- Great.

993
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,088
- No, come on. You gotta do it subtle.
- Great.

994
00:49:29,088 --> 00:49:31,588
More subtle, though. You have to do...

995
00:49:31,588 --> 00:49:33,630
- There you go. Exactly.
- Great.

00:49:47,505 --> 00:49:48,421
Yeah.

1002
00:49:48,421 --> 00:49:50,505
- It's this button, right?
- That's the one.

1003
00:49:50,505 --> 00:49:52,088
[Shelby] The switches stay off?

1004
00:49:52,088 --> 00:49:53,505
That's a bird shadow.

1005
00:49:53,505 --> 00:49:55,755
- [Shelby] Is everybody ready?
- Oh shit, yeah.

1006
00:49:55,755 --> 00:49:58,213
- [Shelby] All right.
- [Maya] It's great luck.

1007
00:49:58,213 --> 00:49:59,130
[Shelby] Three,

1008
00:49:59,921 --> 00:50:00,796
two,

1009
00:50:01,546 --> 00:50:02,380
one.

[Nikki] Vibes.

Spiral emoji. Spiral emoji. Spir--

1017
00:50:57,171 --> 00:50:59,088
Spiral eyes. Spiral eyes. Spiral...

1018
00:50:59,088 --> 00:51:00,671
Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.

1019
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,713
Oh, hey, cutie.

1020
00:51:15,796 --> 00:51:16,963
Oh, hey, cutie.

1021
00:51:21,171 --> 00:51:22,255
Oh, hey, cutie.

1022
00:51:27,755 --> 00:51:29,380

1026
00:51:40,213 --> 00:51:41,838
{\an8}-Hot.
- Marry me.

1027

{\an8}-Suddenly, I'm thirs--
- So much heat.

{\an8}[cell phone chiming]

1029
00:51:48,255 --> 00:51:51,713
{\an8}[muffled voice] We're doing drugs.
What the fuck is he doing?

1030
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:58,713
[disembodied laughter]

1031
00:51:58,713 --> 00:52:01,088
[laughing]

1032
00:52:05,588 --> 00:52:07,463
Do you think you're a good person?

1033
00:52:09,963 --> 00:52:12,630
[Cyrus cackles]

1034
00:52:13,796 --> 00:52:15,796

[inaudible]

1038
00:53:04,838 --> 00:53:06,630
There's something... different.

1039
00:53:08,171 --> 00:53:09,171
[Dennis] Yeah, yeah.

1040
00:53:10,588 --> 00:53:13,755
Yeah, your smile is, like,
more pronounced.

1041
00:53:13,755 --> 00:53:16,088
Oh my God, totally. It's so crazy.

1042
00:53:16,588 --> 00:53:19,838
- Okay, my official guess is that--
- No, no, no.

1043
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:21,630
- Don't guess. Don't guess.
- Why?

1044
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:24,213
Oh, cheater. Not allowed.

1045
00:53:24,713 --> 00:53:26,671
It's way more fun not knowing.

1046
00:53:27,505 --> 00:53:30,630
Like, I have no idea who you are,

1047
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:34,463
but you could kill him,
and I'd still think that it was Brooke.

1048
00:53:34,963 --> 00:53:37,796
We're gonna eventually find out
who everyone is, so not really.

1049
00:53:37,796 --> 00:53:40,630
Yeah, okay, but what if we didn't?

1050
00:53:57,963 --> 00:54:00,546
- [Brooke] Wanna get some wine?
- Um. I've got to just...

1051
00:54:00,546 --> 00:54:05,546
So, what are, like, the current going-ons
with the Buddhist community?

1052
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:09,130
Oh, you know, just, like,
Zen, Zen, Zen, baby.

1053
00:54:09,755 --> 00:54:11,755
[laughing]

1054
00:54:13,421 --> 00:54:14,921
No? Okay.

1055
00:54:14,921 --> 00:54:17,296
- Okay, I'm gonna get some water.
- Okay.

1056
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:18,963
- [door closing]
- [Maya] What?

1057
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:23,046
'Sup?

1058
00:54:23,546 --> 00:54:24,380
[Maya] 'Sup?

[chuckles]

1060
00:54:29,088 --> 00:54:29,963
You, uh...

1061
00:54:31,588 --> 00:54:33,088
checked out the roof yet...

1062
00:54:33,755 --> 00:54:34,588
Maya?

1063
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:39,005
I have not... Dennis. [chuckles]

1064
00:54:45,546 --> 00:54:46,380
Shall we?

1065
00:54:48,213 --> 00:54:49,796
[Maya] Lead the way, good sire.

1066
00:54:52,005 --> 00:54:56,088
[giggles] I make my own shampoo
out of narcissism and oil of humblebrag.

1067
00:54:56,088 --> 00:54:59,921
[laughs]
I like this extremely self-aware Nikki.

1068
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:03,588
- [laughing]
- Oh, look at her go.

1069
00:55:03,588 --> 00:55:05,255
How much did you guys do?

1070
00:55:05,838 --> 00:55:06,880
Yes.

1071
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,088
[all laughing]

1072
00:55:08,088 --> 00:55:09,046
[Cyrus] Yes.

1073
00:55:09,588 --> 00:55:12,463
- [Nikki screams] Oh my God, a spider!
- [Cyrus] Oh shit!

1074
00:55:12,463 --> 00:55:15,296
- [Nikki] There's a huge spider!
- [Cyrus screams]

1075
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:18,088
- Okay.
- [Nikki] No, don't touch it! Oh my God!

1076
00:55:18,671 --> 00:55:20,088
It went into the forest.

1077
00:55:20,088 --> 00:55:21,171
Hey, Nikki, uh...

1078
00:55:22,421 --> 00:55:24,630
Yeah, just Brooke wanted, I think, to, um...

1079
00:55:25,171 --> 00:55:28,546
show you something
in the greenhouse or whatever.

1080
00:55:28,546 --> 00:55:30,671
- Why? What is it? [laughs]
- [Forbes] I don't know.

1081
00:55:30,671 --> 00:55:36,546
She was just like, "Oh, hey, Forbes,
could you just go get Nikki?" You know?

1082
00:55:36,546 --> 00:55:38,130
I was like, "Okay, yeah, cool."

1083
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:42,046
So I'm just... I don't know,
just coming to get you or whatever.

1084
00:55:43,921 --> 00:55:49,630
And other shady-sounding shit
available now on Audible.

1085
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:50,546
That's hilarious.

1086
00:55:50,546 --> 00:55:57,088
Options, take drugs or abscond
with the little boy in body number three.

1087
00:55:57,088 --> 00:56:00,088
Oh yeah, "abscond with the boy."
It seemed a little urgent.

1088
00:56:00,088 --> 00:56:02,630
So I was just thinking
that maybe we should just go right now.

1089
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:04,380
- [Nikki] Okay, Forbes.
- Okay.

1090
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:05,921
Hold your horses.

1091
00:56:05,921 --> 00:56:08,213
- Hold your horses.
- Look how he walks!

1092
00:56:08,213 --> 00:56:10,213
Look how he walks!

1093
00:56:15,755 --> 00:56:16,671
Where's Brooke?

1094
00:56:20,713 --> 00:56:23,713
[Forbes] Are you serious?
I just heard your spider freak-out.

1095
00:56:24,546 --> 00:56:25,546
What do you mean?

1096
00:56:26,796 --> 00:56:29,296
[Forbes] Really, you're gonna do this
to my face right now?

1097
00:56:29,296 --> 00:56:31,546
Okay. Okay, fine.

1098
00:56:31,546 --> 00:56:33,421
God, you win. Are you happy?

1099
00:56:33,421 --> 00:56:35,505
What's the matter? Why are you mad at me?

1100
00:56:35,505 --> 00:56:37,296
I'm just playing the game like you wanted.

1101
00:56:37,296 --> 00:56:39,546
You wanted me to play. Now I'm playing.

1102
00:56:39,546 --> 00:56:43,171
Part of the game is not telling anyone
what you're doing or who you are.

1103
00:56:43,171 --> 00:56:45,005
It's freaking me out right now.

1104
00:56:45,005 --> 00:56:46,796
Just how into this you are.

1105
00:56:46,796 --> 00:56:48,755
I thought we had a deal or whatever.

1106
00:56:48,755 --> 00:56:50,213
- Now you're just like--
- Whoa.

1107
00:56:52,088 --> 00:56:53,505
That's really crazy.

1108
00:56:54,463 --> 00:56:55,296
What?

1109
00:56:58,338 --> 00:57:01,630
I can see your face in Forbes's face.

1110
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:03,588
Like, I can...

1111
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:07,546
Say something else.

1112
00:57:08,755 --> 00:57:09,713
[Forbes] Like what?

1113
00:57:31,463 --> 00:57:32,296
Uh...

1114
00:57:32,838 --> 00:57:34,713
Wait. Um...

1115
00:57:41,421 --> 00:57:43,088
It'll be like I'm wearing a wig.

1116
00:57:43,755 --> 00:57:45,505
[mischievous music playing]

1117
00:57:49,338 --> 00:57:50,171
[Dennis] Yeah.

1118
00:57:53,171 --> 00:57:54,213
Oh, careful, careful.

1119
00:57:54,713 --> 00:57:55,921
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1120
00:57:55,921 --> 00:57:57,296
Sorry, this, uh...

1121
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:00,546
This whole place is falling apart.

1122
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,088
Oh, it's, uh... It's nice up here.

1123
00:58:04,588 --> 00:58:05,463
Yeah.

1124
00:58:06,713 --> 00:58:07,838
Yeah, it is, huh?

1125
00:58:12,005 --> 00:58:13,546
Well, you know, I, uh...

1126
00:58:14,588 --> 00:58:18,088
...thought you'd like it
'cause of your, uh, your wings there.

1127
00:58:18,088 --> 00:58:19,005
[Maya] Oh.

1128
00:58:19,005 --> 00:58:21,338
Right. Yeah. [chuckles]

1129
00:58:21,338 --> 00:58:23,046
But you're also part deer.

1130
00:58:23,546 --> 00:58:26,963
Oh yeah. So I can't get too elevated.

1131
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:29,213
- Oh, right.
- Yeah. [laughs]

1132
00:58:29,213 --> 00:58:32,130
And you like mooning people apparently?

1133
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:35,046
- Apparently hanging out next to teepees.
- Okay.

1134
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,880
And you got some other ones
going on down there.

1135
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:39,838
Wow.

1136
00:58:41,005 --> 00:58:41,838
Really?

1137
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:47,546
Yeah, that was a Dennis thing to say,
because, uh, well, I'm Dennis.

1138
00:58:48,713 --> 00:58:50,171
- Bro. [chuckles]
- Yeah.

1139
00:58:50,838 --> 00:58:52,421
Enjoying it, aren't you?

1140
00:58:52,421 --> 00:58:54,546
- [chuckles] Yeah.
- [laughs]

1141
00:58:58,588 --> 00:58:59,796
I mean, he, uh...

1142
00:59:00,921 --> 00:59:02,338
He does what he wants.

1143
00:59:04,838 --> 00:59:06,046
[Maya] What do you want?

1144
00:59:13,005 --> 00:59:15,005
[both breathing heavily]

1146
00:59:19,296 --> 00:59:20,296
Call me Nikki.

1147
00:59:20,296 --> 00:59:21,463
Oh, you're high.

1148
00:59:21,463 --> 00:59:22,921
It's okay, honey.

1149
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:28,880
Say it.

1150
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,171
Uh...

1151
00:59:30,171 --> 00:59:31,296
Nikki. [snickers]

1152
00:59:32,713 --> 00:59:33,963
Yeah, say it again.

1153
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:36,671
[moans] Nikki.

1154
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:39,213
Nikki.

Nikki.

1156
00:59:42,505 --> 00:59:43,338
Nikki.

1157
00:59:44,463 --> 00:59:45,338
Sorry, sorry.

1158
00:59:46,338 --> 00:59:47,588
For what?

1159
00:59:49,921 --> 00:59:51,630
[gravel crunching]

1160
00:59:55,713 --> 00:59:57,630
- Tell me you want me.
- I want you.

1161
00:59:58,130 --> 00:59:59,505
I want you, Nikki.

1162

[moaning and electricity crackling]

1163
01:00:03,255 --> 01:00:05,755
- [distorted] Forbes.
- [moans]

1164
01:00:05,755 --> 01:00:06,713
Forbes.

1165
01:00:07,338 --> 01:00:08,255
Forbes.

1166
01:00:08,255 --> 01:00:11,421
- [groaning] Wait.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1167
01:00:11,421 --> 01:00:12,630
Tell me you want me.

1168
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:14,671
- What?
- I can't do this.

1169
01:00:14,671 --> 01:00:16,546
- No, come here.
- [distorted] No, stop.

1170
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:18,630

1173
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:36,171
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.

1174
01:00:39,671 --> 01:00:41,005
You look just like her.

1175
01:00:43,296 --> 01:00:45,171
[electronic crackling]

1176
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:49,838
Keep talking to me. Keep talking to me.

1177
01:00:51,671 --> 01:00:53,338
- Do you know who I am?
- Yeah.

1178
01:00:54,005 --> 01:00:55,671
I know who you are. I don't care.

1179
01:00:56,171 --> 01:00:57,296
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1180
01:00:57,296 --> 01:00:58,963
Yeah. I wanna be with you.

1181
01:00:58,963 --> 01:01:00,921
[Cyrus] I don't wanna do this anymore.

1182
01:01:00,921 --> 01:01:03,005
I wanna go inside,
tell everyone who we are,

1183
01:01:03,005 --> 01:01:06,005
or I'll guess you, you guess me,
everyone will find out, then we'll switch.

1184
01:01:06,005 --> 01:01:07,088
I can't do this anymore.

1185
01:01:07,088 --> 01:01:09,171
- Why are you gonna do that?
- You're freaking me out.

1186
01:01:09,171 --> 01:01:10,630
I'm freaked the fuck out right now.

1187
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:13,421
- You're acting like a different person.
- Look at me.

1188
01:01:13,421 --> 01:01:14,796
I am a different person.

1189
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:17,380
You see what I...
You can hear yourself, right?

1190
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:21,255
Cyrus, it's a game,
and you're being a sore fucking loser.

1191
01:01:21,255 --> 01:01:22,588
You wanna fuck Forbes.

1192
01:01:22,588 --> 01:01:25,296
I saw you talking to him.
Asking him, "How do I use the machine?"

1193
01:01:25,296 --> 01:01:27,213
I don't wanna fuck Forbes,
I wanna fuck you.

1194
01:01:27,213 --> 01:01:29,130
Because I'm in Forbes's body!

1195
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:32,088
Forbes's body, your body.
I can't get laid by you in any body

1196
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:34,880
because all you do
is jerk off on your fucking laptop!

1197
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:37,463
Wait, I'm sorry.
We're not supposed to talk about that.

1198
01:01:37,463 --> 01:01:39,046
Guess I have to just feel guilty

1199
01:01:39,046 --> 01:01:41,546
about masturbating in the shower
with my loofah brush!

1200
01:01:41,546 --> 01:01:44,546
I'm going inside and telling everyone
who we are, and we're done.

1201
01:01:44,546 --> 01:01:46,338
- [Shelby] No!
- I can't do this.

1202
01:01:46,338 --> 01:01:48,630
- I can't do this anymore
- Cyrus, come back. Cyrus!

1203
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:50,838
- Say it again.
- I wanna be with you.

1204
01:01:52,463 --> 01:01:53,671
I wanna be with you.

1205
01:01:54,171 --> 01:01:56,630
- I love you.
- I love you. I love you.

1206
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:59,713
Couldn't keep your eyes off the mirror!
Classic Nikki!

1207
01:01:59,713 --> 01:02:01,630
You're Dennis
because you're being an asshole.

1208
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:04,046
You're not allowed to guess!
You're out of the game!

1209
01:02:04,046 --> 01:02:06,338
- Dennis. Final answer.
- Nah, fuck that shit!

1210
01:02:06,338 --> 01:02:09,421
That doesn't fucking count!
That shit doesn't fucking count.

1211
01:02:09,421 --> 01:02:11,046
[Forbes] You're acting crazy!

1212
01:02:11,046 --> 01:02:13,963
- [Reuben] I wanna marry you.
- [Brooke] I've always wanted you.

1213
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:15,546
[Brooke moans] I wanna marry you.

1214
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:18,296
Everyone, I'm making an official guess...

1215
01:02:18,296 --> 01:02:20,130
[Brooke] Reuben! Reuben! [screams]

1216
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:22,588
...that Shelby is in Nikki's body!

1217
01:02:22,588 --> 01:02:23,963
[thud]

1218
01:02:23,963 --> 01:02:26,046

01:02:42,005 --> 01:02:46,005
[electronic crackling and wailing]

1221
01:03:10,755 --> 01:03:12,588
[music becomes frenetic]

1222
01:03:23,755 --> 01:03:25,755
[music fades]

[silence]

1228
01:04:06,796 --> 01:04:08,338
[Cyrus spluttering]

1229
01:04:08,338 --> 01:04:09,838
[Cyrus] What do I...

1230
01:04:09,838 --> 01:04:11,546
What do I...

1231
01:04:11,546 --> 01:04:13,796
What do I do? What do I do?

1232
01:04:14,296 --> 01:04:16,880
What does this mean?

1233
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,046
What the fuck? Is this real?

1234
01:04:19,046 --> 01:04:20,838
Is this real? What...

1235
01:04:21,505 --> 01:04:23,213
What do we do?

1236
01:04:23,213 --> 01:04:25,505
Where's Forbes?
Is this Forbes? Are you Forbes?

1237
01:04:25,505 --> 01:04:26,713
I'm Forbes.

1238
01:04:27,963 --> 01:04:30,171
I can go back, right?
I can go back in my body?

1239
01:04:30,171 --> 01:04:33,755
You can put me back in my body, right?
You took me out. You can put me back in.

1240
01:04:33,755 --> 01:04:35,588
I can't. I...

1241
01:04:35,588 --> 01:04:37,546
- I can't.
- What the fuck does that mean?

1242
01:04:37,546 --> 01:04:40,505
{\an8}[Forbes] I can't put you in a dead body.
There's nothing to put you in.

1243
01:04:40,505 --> 01:04:43,505
{\an8}Wait, wait, wait. Who is that?
Is that... Is that Shelby?

1244
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:45,505
{\an8}No, I'm... I'm Shelby.

1245
01:04:46,005 --> 01:04:47,088
{\an8}[Reuben] That's Brooke!

1246
01:04:50,005 --> 01:04:51,171
{\an8}And that's Reuben.

1247
01:04:52,963 --> 01:04:55,171
So then, Maya is...

1248
01:04:55,171 --> 01:04:58,005
- [eerie music plays]
- [Cyrus] Call someone on your team.

1249
01:04:58,005 --> 01:05:00,171
Call someone.
Figure out what we're gonna do.

1250
01:05:00,171 --> 01:05:01,630
- There is--
- No, get the fuck--

1251
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:04,005
There's nothing that they can fucking do!

1252
01:05:04,005 --> 01:05:05,921
{\an8}[Cyrus] Tell me
what we're gonna do right now!

1253
01:05:05,921 --> 01:05:07,546
{\an8}[sobbing]

1254
01:05:08,213 --> 01:05:09,046
Maya?

1255
01:05:09,046 --> 01:05:11,588
[Cyrus and Reuben shouting in distance]

1256
01:05:13,046 --> 01:05:13,880
Maya.

1257
01:05:15,046 --> 01:05:16,463
[distorted] Maya's gone now.

1258
01:05:17,796 --> 01:05:19,005
- You can do this.
- I can't.

1259
01:05:19,005 --> 01:05:21,588
- Yes, you can.
- I can't.

1260
01:05:21,588 --> 01:05:23,380
- Yes, you can.
- Okay? Okay?

1261
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:24,963
- You can.
- I fucking can't.

1262
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:28,005
[distorted] Yeah, you can.
Yes, you can. You can do this.

1263
01:05:28,505 --> 01:05:30,671
[distorted] There is nothing I can do.

1264
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:36,921
{\an8}- [Cyrus] Fuck! [echoing]
- [music ends]

1265
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,588
[thunder rumbling]

1266
01:05:46,213 --> 01:05:48,588
[footsteps approaching]

1267
01:06:05,755 --> 01:06:08,255
{\an8}- [inhales]
- [neck cracking]

1268
01:06:09,255 --> 01:06:11,255
[pigeon cooing]

1269
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:21,005
{\an8}[Forbes] Guys, I feel like maybe
we should go do something with the bodies.

1270
01:06:21,713 --> 01:06:23,255
We can't touch the bodies.

1271
01:06:23,255 --> 01:06:27,005
[Forbes] No, I know, but they're just
laying up there on that fucking thing.

1272
01:06:27,005 --> 01:06:28,671
It just feels weird.

1273
01:06:29,713 --> 01:06:32,463
{\an8}- It's their bodies, so--
- Keep your voice down.

1274
01:06:32,963 --> 01:06:33,880
{\an8}[sighing]

1275
01:06:38,921 --> 01:06:42,046
[Nikki] I didn't realize
Brooke was actually jealous of Sophia.

1276
01:06:45,505 --> 01:06:48,546
Can't believe Reuben was hooking up
with her the night before the wedding.

1277
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:51,671
He wasn't. He was hooking up with Maya.

1278
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,421
They were a thing, remember?

1279
01:06:54,421 --> 01:06:58,088
{\an8}Okay, guys. We've been standing here
for an hour and a half.

1280
01:06:58,088 --> 01:07:00,713
{\an8}We gotta figure out what to do.
We gotta call the cops.

1281
01:07:00,713 --> 01:07:03,880
{\an8}- The longer we stand out here, it's just--
- We're not... No, no.

1282
01:07:04,505 --> 01:07:06,005
{\an8}We're not calling the cops.

1283
01:07:06,505 --> 01:07:07,338
{\an8}No way.

1284
01:07:09,005 --> 01:07:10,713
{\an8}What are you talking about?

1285
01:07:10,713 --> 01:07:13,546
{\an8}There's a highly valuable
piece of machinery in there,

1286
01:07:14,046 --> 01:07:17,213
{\an8}and I'm not letting the cops
get their hands on that.

1287
01:07:18,505 --> 01:07:21,588
{\an8}- How is that my problem?
- [Forbes] Guys, guys, guys. Come on.

1288
01:07:27,046 --> 01:07:29,171
{\an8}Are you even supposed to have
that machine out here?

1289
01:07:29,171 --> 01:07:30,213
{\an8}It's mine.

1290
01:07:31,588 --> 01:07:33,755
{\an8}[Brooke] It's yours or it's your team's?

1291
01:07:35,046 --> 01:07:37,963
{\an8}How would your team be okay with you
having this valuable machine

1292
01:07:37,963 --> 01:07:39,463
{\an8}out here for a party game?

1293
01:07:41,755 --> 01:07:45,046
{\an8}Whatever shit you're up to,
I'm not gonna go to jail because of it.

1294
01:07:45,046 --> 01:07:47,296
{\an8}So we're gonna switch back,
and I'm gonna call the cops.

1295
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:48,380
Absolutely not!

1296
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:50,755
- Whoa. Hey, guys. Guys.
- What the fuck?

1297
01:07:50,755 --> 01:07:51,796
Um...

1298
01:07:51,796 --> 01:07:53,046
I think she's right.

1299
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:57,921
Okay? You know what? I think maybe
we should all just go back inside

1300
01:07:57,921 --> 01:08:01,046
and just switch back, okay?

1301
01:08:01,046 --> 01:08:05,171
And no one has to know about the machine,
if it's a problem. Right?

1302
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:08,213
Right?
Like, they fell off the fucking roof.

1303
01:08:08,213 --> 01:08:10,880
- It's not like we did anything. Right?
- [Nikki] Agreed.

1304
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:13,713
[Cyrus] The hell you talkin' about,
"switch back"?

1305
01:08:17,046 --> 01:08:18,546
We've already switched.

1306
01:08:21,213 --> 01:08:22,546
This is our rebirth.

1307
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:28,921
Look, guys,
I know we could all use a beat.

1308
01:08:29,546 --> 01:08:30,921
Okay? Especially you guys.

1309
01:08:31,671 --> 01:08:32,505
But...

1310
01:08:33,671 --> 01:08:37,130
I just think that maybe we should
just step inside...

1311
01:08:38,505 --> 01:08:39,671
and...

1312
01:08:41,213 --> 01:08:42,796
- Um...
- And what?

1313
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:46,921
Huh?

1314
01:08:49,046 --> 01:08:50,213
Come on, bro. Say it.

1315
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:55,130
{\an8}[Forbes] Look, man, I know that this is--

1316
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:56,171
{\an8}This is what?

1317
01:08:58,588 --> 01:09:00,338
{\an8}There's no other option. I mean...

1318
01:09:01,046 --> 01:09:03,713
{\an8}You obviously
have to go into Reuben's body.

1319
01:09:04,213 --> 01:09:05,046
{\an8}No.

1320
01:09:07,713 --> 01:09:09,296
{\an8}Dude, look, it's--

1321
01:09:09,296 --> 01:09:11,213
{\an8}So Maya and I are just shit out of luck?

1322
01:09:11,713 --> 01:09:15,713
{\an8}I have to stay in Reuben's body
for the rest of my fucking life, bro?

1323
01:09:17,921 --> 01:09:21,630
{\an8}You have to stay in someone else's body
for the rest of your life, no matter what.

1324
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:23,213
{\an8}Yeah, but you don't, do you?

1325
01:09:24,505 --> 01:09:26,546
{\an8}- It's not really fair, is it?
- [Brooke] Guys.

1326
01:09:28,255 --> 01:09:30,630
{\an8}Fair? What the fuck?
I didn't even wanna play the game.

1327
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:33,171
{\an8}You are such a little bitch.
You know that, bro?

1328
01:09:33,171 --> 01:09:34,880
{\an8}You've always been a little bitch.

1329
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,630
{\an8}You didn't have to fucking play.
You could've sat out.

1330
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:40,171
{\an8}If I'm such a little bitch,
why'd you wanna stay in my body?

1331
01:09:40,171 --> 01:09:41,588
{\an8}- It's the fucking principle!
- Guys!

1332
01:09:41,588 --> 01:09:44,005
{\an8}What the fuck does that even mean?

1333
01:09:44,005 --> 01:09:47,755
{\an8}I mean, honestly, being in Reuben's body
could be a good thing for you.

1334
01:09:48,255 --> 01:09:50,213
{\an8}Yeah, it could be like a fresh start.

1335
01:09:50,213 --> 01:09:52,963
{\an8}Oh, well,
Forbes could be your fresh start.

1336
01:09:54,421 --> 01:09:55,755
{\an8}I'm in a relationship.

1337
01:09:57,171 --> 01:09:58,296
{\an8}When's the wedding?

1338
01:09:59,671 --> 01:10:01,963
{\an8}That's huge fucking talk
coming from you, man.

1339
01:10:02,838 --> 01:10:03,755
{\an8}Coming from me?

1340
01:10:08,588 --> 01:10:10,838
{\an8}- Guys, can we--
- This has been on your mind all night.

1341
01:10:10,838 --> 01:10:13,588
{\an8}- We need to call the cops.
- No, I'll get it started.

1342
01:10:13,588 --> 01:10:14,546
Okay.

1343
01:10:14,546 --> 01:10:17,796
{\an8}I cheated on Nikki
with Forbes's crazy fucking sister

1344
01:10:17,796 --> 01:10:19,296
{\an8}when she was still in high school.

1345
01:10:19,296 --> 01:10:20,713
{\an8}Now everyone remembers.

1346
01:10:20,713 --> 01:10:23,171
{\an8}I hooked up with Beatrice. Okay?

1347
01:10:23,171 --> 01:10:26,463
{\an8}- Okay. Let it out.
- You told Nikki because you're a good guy.

1348
01:10:26,463 --> 01:10:27,380
{\an8}Right?

1349
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:29,213
{\an8}That's why you told her.
You're a good guy?

1350
01:10:29,213 --> 01:10:31,796
{\an8}- Okay, yeah. [exhales]
- Or was it something else?

1351
01:10:33,671 --> 01:10:35,588
{\an8}[Cyrus] Oh, that's right.

1352
01:10:35,588 --> 01:10:38,838
{\an8}- You wanted to fuck her.
- [Brooke] Dennis, shut the fuck up!

1353
01:10:38,838 --> 01:10:41,463
{\an8}- Didn't you even ask her out after?
- [Forbes] He's losing it.

1354
01:10:41,463 --> 01:10:45,255
{\an8}- [Cyrus] Then she obviously said no.
- [Forbes] He's fucking losing it.

1355
01:10:45,255 --> 01:10:46,713
{\an8}[Cyrus] So you looked around...

1356
01:10:46,713 --> 01:10:49,588
{\an8}- [Forbes] Can you please stop?
- [Cyrus] ...and who did you see?

1357
01:10:49,588 --> 01:10:51,296
{\an8}- [Cyrus] Oh, Shelby.
- [Forbes] Stop.

1358
01:10:51,296 --> 01:10:53,046
{\an8}[Cyrus mocking] "Hi. I'm Cyrus."

1359
01:10:53,046 --> 01:10:55,130
{\an8}[Forbes] Stop! Jesus fucking Christ!

1360
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:58,671
{\an8}So that's why you've been
in a relationship for nine years, because...

1361
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,296
{\an8}You're such a fucking asshole.

1362
01:11:00,296 --> 01:11:01,213
{\an8}...she said no.

1363
01:11:01,213 --> 01:11:03,213
{\an8}- You're such a fucking dick.
- [Brooke] Guys.

1364
01:11:03,713 --> 01:11:06,130
{\an8}You had so much going for you.

1365
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:07,755
{\an8}- Yeah?
- You were so cool.

1366
01:11:07,755 --> 01:11:09,671
{\an8}Big fucking cool guy on campus.

1367
01:11:09,671 --> 01:11:11,463
{\an8}And then what happened to you?

1368
01:11:11,463 --> 01:11:13,380
{\an8}- What happened after college?
- What happened?

1369
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:15,546
{\an8}- What the fuck happened? Nothing.
- What hap--?

1370
01:11:16,421 --> 01:11:17,546
{\an8}You became nothing.

1371
01:11:19,213 --> 01:11:20,255
{\an8}A fucking waste.

1372
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:25,588
{\an8}You don't even have the excuse
of having to get a fucking day job

1373
01:11:25,588 --> 01:11:27,005
{\an8}or doing anything with your life,

1374
01:11:27,005 --> 01:11:29,755
{\an8}because you're living off
your parents's fucking money.

1375
01:11:31,755 --> 01:11:35,505
{\an8}You should be jumping at the opportunity
to take over Reuben's life,

1376
01:11:35,505 --> 01:11:38,380
{\an8}because he has done more
in the past year of his life

1377
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:40,713
{\an8}than you have in the past fucking ten.

1378
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:43,255
{\an8}Guys, can we please just calm down?

1379
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,546
{\an8}[Forbes] What are you doing?

1380
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:01,921
{\an8}[keypad beeping]

1381
01:12:02,838 --> 01:12:05,088
- Guys, can we--
- 911, what's your emergency?

1382
01:12:05,088 --> 01:12:06,171
[weakly] Hello?

1383
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:08,921
This is Cyrus Baum.

1384
01:12:09,546 --> 01:12:13,546
I pushed Dennis Markowitz
and Maya Wilson off the roof.

1385
01:12:13,546 --> 01:12:14,963
- Get off the phone.
- They're dead!

1386
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:16,588
- Get off the phone!
- I killed them!

1387
01:12:16,588 --> 01:12:18,505
- I killed them! They're dead!
- Hey! Stop!

1388
01:12:18,505 --> 01:12:19,880
What the fuck are you doing?

1389
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:23,171
{\an8}- I'm at 1832 North Crescent Avenue!
- Stop!

1390
01:12:23,171 --> 01:12:25,588
{\an8}Are you fucking crazy?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1391
01:12:25,588 --> 01:12:27,505
{\an8}- We can switch now!
- Guys.

1392
01:12:27,505 --> 01:12:28,630
Guys!

1393
01:12:30,671 --> 01:12:31,755
Where's Forbes?

[panting]

1396
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:39,630
Fuck. Forbes!

1397
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,255
- Forbes!
- [huffing]

1398
01:12:42,255 --> 01:12:43,255
Come on, man!

1399
01:12:43,921 --> 01:12:46,380
- [Forbes] Hey! Forbes!
- [Brooke grunts]

1400

[thuds]

1401
01:12:57,713 --> 01:12:58,838
What?

1402
01:12:59,421 --> 01:13:01,421
[Brooke] How much time
before the cops get here?

1403
01:13:01,421 --> 01:13:03,171
Twenty, thirty minutes tops?

1404
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:04,671
We still wanna switch, right?

1405
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:06,255
- Even after he called the cops?
- Yeah.

1406
01:13:06,255 --> 01:13:09,630
I'm gonna need you to say I was forced,
or I was drunk or stoned,

1407
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:12,380
or having a fucking mental health crisis
or something.

1408
01:13:13,130 --> 01:13:15,838
- Yeah? You can do that? Hello? Yes?
- Yes. We just...

1409
01:13:16,338 --> 01:13:18,255
How are we gonna get him
to switch us back?

1410
01:13:18,255 --> 01:13:20,130
Shelby knows
how to work the machine, remember?

1411
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:22,005
Okay, does she actually?

1412
01:13:22,005 --> 01:13:24,546
He said there's only enough battery left
for one more round.

1413
01:13:24,546 --> 01:13:26,755
- Do you want this guy to do it?
- Is he dead?

1414
01:13:26,755 --> 01:13:27,671
- No!
- No!

1415
01:13:27,671 --> 01:13:29,255
Thanks for your help, by the way.

1416
01:13:29,255 --> 01:13:32,338

Only thing this body knows how to do.

Honey, I'm gonna need your help
to use the machine.

- I don't wanna go back.

[Forbes] We don't have time for this.

1428
01:14:07,921 --> 01:14:10,505
You said it yourself
this could be a fresh start, a rebirth.

1429
01:14:10,505 --> 01:14:12,421
I was saying that
to get him out of my body.

1430
01:14:12,421 --> 01:14:13,505
Okay, hey. Look at me.

1431
01:14:16,171 --> 01:14:18,380
See that over there? That's your body.

1432
01:14:19,713 --> 01:14:21,796
{\an8}- That's my body.
- Maya's body's out back.

1433
01:14:22,796 --> 01:14:24,671
So obviously, things are different now.

Why do you think I don't wanna--?

01:14:34,963 --> 01:14:37,171
{\an8}I mean,
you said you wanted a cultural experience.

doesn't mean--

Oh, so now you know how I feel
about my life?

- So you're jealous of my work.
- [Cyrus] Her work!

the amount of charities
and non-profit organizations I work with?

- [Nikki] Like the Water Project.
- Yes. Like the Water Project.

The Water Project.

1454
01:15:14,755 --> 01:15:17,421
We provide clean water
to third-world countries.

1455
01:15:17,421 --> 01:15:19,505
That's why you do it?
For third-world countries?

- I don't have to--
- Interesting.

over the whole white savior thing?"

if you can keep my fucking body.

who knows how to work the machine,

so we can just force her to do it.

what are you doing down here?

So I was the consolation prize.

No, you're obviously not.

1485
01:16:34,838 --> 01:16:36,921
And be careful.
I cut myself on that chair.

when we get back into our bodies.

{\an8}- But right now, we need--
- [Nikki] I wanna talk about it now.

1494
01:17:09,463 --> 01:17:11,463
{\an8}I don't wanna talk about it later.

01:17:22,713 --> 01:17:23,588
{\an8}I don't know.

1497
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:37,296
Are you not attracted to me?

1498
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:38,755
[Forbes] I am.

1499
01:17:42,088 --> 01:17:43,088
Then what is it?

1500
01:17:57,338 --> 01:17:58,255
{\an8}I'm fucked up.

1501
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:04,588
{\an8}I'm fucked up, okay?

1502
01:18:05,671 --> 01:18:12,005
{\an8}I watch fucked-up shit online,
and I... avoid you.

1503
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:16,255
{\an8}And... And... And I'm...
I'm just a fucking mess.

1504
01:18:20,838 --> 01:18:21,838
It's all just...

1505
01:18:26,546 --> 01:18:28,963
But... But we can talk about it now.

1506
01:18:30,088 --> 01:18:30,921
Okay?

1507
01:18:32,838 --> 01:18:33,796
Moving forward.

1508
01:18:36,171 --> 01:18:37,171
And I'm gonna stop.

1509
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:39,838
And I'm gonna pay more attention to you.

1510
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:45,463
Okay, honey?
If I didn't have you in my life,

1511
01:18:45,463 --> 01:18:47,296
I wouldn't have anything at all.

1512
01:18:50,421 --> 01:18:51,796
[inhales] Okay? I love you.

1513
01:18:53,588 --> 01:18:54,713
{\an8}I love you so much.

1514
01:18:57,005 --> 01:19:00,713
{\an8}See? I don't wanna be
looking at this Nikki face.

1515
01:19:00,713 --> 01:19:03,838
I wanna be looking
at your face right now. Okay?

1516
01:19:06,088 --> 01:19:10,546
{\an8}See? This... This is the face that I want.

1517
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:15,630
{\an8}This is the first-prize face that I chose
and that I want in my life.

1518
01:19:17,005 --> 01:19:19,713
Okay? This whole night
has been so fucked up.

1519
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:23,255
{\an8}The thing is,
it's made me realize what I want

1520
01:19:23,255 --> 01:19:25,171
{\an8}and who I need to be.

1521
01:19:27,296 --> 01:19:28,963
And I don't need to be...

1522
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:30,463
Forbes

1523
01:19:30,463 --> 01:19:31,796
{\an8}or Reuben,

1524
01:19:31,796 --> 01:19:33,505
{\an8}or any of those guys.

1525
01:19:35,755 --> 01:19:36,755
{\an8}I need to be me.

1526
01:19:40,005 --> 01:19:41,630
Cyrus the Vyrus. [snorts]

1527
01:19:45,171 --> 01:19:48,046
And I wanna be with you
for the rest of my life.

1528
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:49,463
Okay?

1529
01:19:50,463 --> 01:19:55,005
{\an8}Honey, let's go back, and we'll spend
the rest of our lives together, okay?

1530
01:19:59,171 --> 01:20:00,005
Okay?

1531
01:20:08,671 --> 01:20:09,963
[Shelby] Wait.

1532
01:20:12,255 --> 01:20:13,630
{\an8}Wait. Quick question.

1533
01:20:15,296 --> 01:20:17,505
{\an8}When did you cut yourself on this chair?

1534
01:20:21,463 --> 01:20:22,671
Shelbow, come on.

1535
01:20:24,588 --> 01:20:26,713
{\an8}Were you in Reuben's body round one?

1536
01:20:31,671 --> 01:20:32,630
Was that you?

1537
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:35,005
Shelbow, please, we have to go. Come on.

1538
01:20:35,588 --> 01:20:36,463
{\an8}It was you.

1539
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:41,171
{\an8}You were trying to hook up with me
when I was in Nikki's body.

1540
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:43,880
{\an8}Can you please stop talking?

1541
01:20:45,463 --> 01:20:46,296
{\an8}Dude.

1542
01:20:47,546 --> 01:20:49,088
{\an8}You said you were Forbes.

1543
01:20:52,463 --> 01:20:53,838
I'm such an idiot.

1544
01:20:54,630 --> 01:20:55,921
Shelbow, honey?

1545
01:20:55,921 --> 01:20:58,338
Honey, the police are gonna be here
any second now.

1546
01:20:58,338 --> 01:20:59,296
So come on.

1547
01:21:00,963 --> 01:21:01,921
Go cry to them.

1548
01:21:03,588 --> 01:21:06,338
[footsteps fading]

1549
01:21:10,171 --> 01:21:12,588
Dude, I know that you just saw
your own dead body

1550
01:21:12,588 --> 01:21:14,380
{\an8}and you can't go back,
but seriously, fuck!

1551
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:15,421
This is all karma.

1552
01:21:15,421 --> 01:21:17,963
The guy I was
in a relationship with was married,

1553
01:21:17,963 --> 01:21:20,921
and I feel like I've reincarnated
into Shelby's body,

1554
01:21:20,921 --> 01:21:24,421
into this new vessel,
to come here and correct all of our sins.

1555
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:25,963
- To teach--
- Shut up!

1556
01:21:25,963 --> 01:21:27,296
{\an8}[Brooke] Hey. Forbes?

1557
01:21:28,005 --> 01:21:30,088
{\an8}Forbes? Hey. Hey, Forbes.

1558
01:21:30,088 --> 01:21:33,630
- Hi! Hey! It's okay. You're okay.
- Hey, what the fuck?

1559
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:35,588
Shh. You're fine. You're fine.

1560
01:21:35,588 --> 01:21:37,421
Forbes. Hey, you're good.

1561
01:21:37,421 --> 01:21:39,921
Look, I need you to do something for me.

1562
01:21:39,921 --> 01:21:42,338
I need you to switch us back. Okay?

1563
01:21:42,338 --> 01:21:44,005
So I'm gonna untie you.

1564
01:21:44,005 --> 01:21:46,255
We're on a time crunch.
We need to switch everybody back.

1565
01:21:46,255 --> 01:21:47,963
No one's switching anyone back.

1566
01:21:47,963 --> 01:21:49,338
[tense music playing]

1567
01:21:49,338 --> 01:21:52,171
- I need you to leave.
- We're gonna go upstairs.

1568
01:21:52,171 --> 01:21:55,005
The cops are gonna be here
in 15, 20 minutes, so we gotta be fast.

1569
01:21:55,005 --> 01:21:57,630
Hey, guys.
Just wanted to jump on here real quick.

1570
01:21:57,630 --> 01:22:01,296
Real talk, fuck the Water Project
or any fucking charity.

1571
01:22:01,296 --> 01:22:04,963
Um, if you guys wanna donate,
I'm starting a Patreon for a boob job.

1572
01:22:04,963 --> 01:22:08,130
Um, P.S., non sequitur,
is anyone else like totally over

1573
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:10,713
the whole Black Lives Matter shit,
or is that just me?

1574
01:22:10,713 --> 01:22:12,546
Let me know below. Love and light!

1575
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:21,338
{\an8}You're a fucking psycho.

1576
01:22:22,838 --> 01:22:24,005
You need to leave.

1577
01:22:33,921 --> 01:22:35,921
[tense music builds]

1578
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:45,421
So the cops show up and then what?

1579
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:49,921
You stay in Nikki's body forever?

1580
01:22:52,213 --> 01:22:53,130
I don't know.

1581
01:22:56,338 --> 01:22:57,338
You wouldn't get it.

1582
01:22:57,338 --> 01:22:59,421
[Reuben laughs]

1583
01:23:01,338 --> 01:23:02,171
Get what?

1584
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:07,088
How liars get away with shit?

1585
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:15,213
Yeah.

1586
01:23:15,213 --> 01:23:16,130
[Reuben] Hmm.

1587
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:21,921
You wanna know
what I'd do if I were in your shoes?

1588
01:23:27,963 --> 01:23:28,796
What?

1589
01:23:30,588 --> 01:23:32,338
- [Brooke] I need--
- We need to talk.

1590
01:23:34,088 --> 01:23:37,088
{\an8}- Shelby. Shelby.
- What the fuck are they doing?

1591
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:38,171
{\an8}[door slamming]

1592
01:23:38,171 --> 01:23:39,255
Shelby.

1593
01:23:39,255 --> 01:23:41,005
{\an8}Okay, look.

1594
01:23:41,588 --> 01:23:43,380
{\an8}I want you to tell me what you want.

1595
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:46,171
{\an8}I feel like I have told you.
I don't know what else to say.

1596
01:23:46,171 --> 01:23:49,505
{\an8}If what you want is to go back,
I will switch us back right now.

1597
01:23:49,505 --> 01:23:52,005
{\an8}We'll sort this thing with the cops out,
if you really want.

1598
01:23:52,005 --> 01:23:53,296
{\an8}Okay. Great.

1599
01:23:53,296 --> 01:23:57,005
{\an8}But if what you really want... is Nikki,

1600
01:23:57,005 --> 01:23:59,796
{\an8}if that's what you've always wanted,
deep down...

1601
01:24:01,838 --> 01:24:02,963
{\an8}I want you to tell me.

1602
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:05,588
{\an8}We can make it work.

1603
01:24:09,963 --> 01:24:10,963
{\an8}Make what work?

1604
01:24:12,505 --> 01:24:15,921
{\an8}I stay in Nikki's body.
You go into Reuben's body.

1605
01:24:15,921 --> 01:24:17,255
{\an8}Reuben doesn't get married.

1606
01:24:17,255 --> 01:24:19,630
{\an8}Instead, he runs off
with his college friend Nikki.

1607
01:24:20,296 --> 01:24:22,171
Dennis deals with the cops on his own.

1608
01:24:25,088 --> 01:24:26,421
{\an8}We really start fresh.

1609
01:24:27,588 --> 01:24:31,255
Forbes! You need to tell me
what the fuck is going on right now.

1610
01:24:31,255 --> 01:24:32,505
{\an8}If I'm being honest,

1611
01:24:32,505 --> 01:24:36,130
{\an8}there's a 50/50 chance
that Shelby's gonna hijack your body.

1612
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:39,880
{\an8}Shelbow, I don't know
if you're joking right now, or... Or... Or...

1613
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:41,005
{\an8}[voices in distance]

1614
01:24:41,005 --> 01:24:43,588

- We need to make a decision.

01:24:44,171 --> 01:24:46,171
{\an8}[tense music continues]

1616
01:24:49,005 --> 01:24:49,838
{\an8}Okay.

1617

{\an8}Okay, what?

1618
01:24:56,088 --> 01:24:56,921
{\an8}Okay.

1619
01:24:57,546 --> 01:24:59,588
{\an8}Yeah. I'll go into Reuben's body.

1620
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,046
What do we tell everyone?

1621
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:04,046
[Reuben] I need to get into my body,

1622
01:25:04,046 --> 01:25:06,963
I need to get my machine
before the cops get here.

1623
01:25:07,463 --> 01:25:08,505
Okay.

1624
01:25:08,505 --> 01:25:11,713
I will untie you,
you will switch us back into our bodies,

1625
01:25:11,713 --> 01:25:14,046
and I will help you get away
or whatever the fuck.

1626
01:25:14,546 --> 01:25:15,796
I have a plan.

1627
01:25:15,796 --> 01:25:17,046
- What is it?
- Fuck.

1628
01:25:17,046 --> 01:25:20,005
Guys! The cops are down the driveway.

1629
01:25:20,005 --> 01:25:20,921
[Brooke] Fuck.

1630
01:25:21,505 --> 01:25:23,255
Are you sure this is what you want?

1631
01:25:26,296 --> 01:25:27,130
Yeah.

1632
01:25:28,338 --> 01:25:30,588
Okay, I have a plan.
You just have to trust me.

1633
01:25:30,588 --> 01:25:33,255
- I need you in on this.
- I'm pretty sure I'm still fucking high.

1634
01:25:33,255 --> 01:25:35,921
I don't know who's who or what's what.
I'm fucking confused, bro.

1635
01:25:35,921 --> 01:25:37,088
Okay, listen.

1636
01:25:37,088 --> 01:25:39,421
[mechanical whirring]

1637
01:25:39,421 --> 01:25:42,380
{\an8}Shelby is telling us that
she's gonna switch back into her body.

1638
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:44,088
{\an8}Cyrus will switch back into his body.

1639
01:25:44,088 --> 01:25:45,838
{\an8}Forbes and I back into our own bodies.

- Right?
- Yeah?

1644
01:25:53,255 --> 01:25:55,463
Except that's not really
what they're gonna do.

1645
01:25:55,463 --> 01:25:56,880
Really what they're gonna do

1646
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:00,088
{\an8}is Shelby is going to stay in my body,
take my life.

1647
01:26:00,088 --> 01:26:02,838
{\an8}Cyrus is gonna switch
into Reuben's body, take his life,

1648
01:26:02,838 --> 01:26:06,088
ditch Sophia for Nikki,
have a fuckfest or rob banks or whatever.

1649
01:26:06,088 --> 01:26:07,088
{\an8}Maya goes into Shelby,

1650
01:26:07,088 --> 01:26:08,380
{\an8}Forbes into his own body.

1651
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:10,380
{\an8}Meanwhile, I'm left in Brooke's body.

1652
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:11,546
{\an8}You're left in Cyrus's body,

1653
01:26:11,546 --> 01:26:13,796
i.e., you go to jail
and get fucking rammed.

- Yeah.

No. I don't know.

- You wanna go to jail?

- No?
- Okay.

So the three of us go up there,

I didn't promise her anything.

1825
01:33:43,505 --> 01:33:45,546
She was crazy,
having all these freak-outs.

1826
01:33:45,546 --> 01:33:47,296
[Forbes] Episodes.
They're called episodes.

1827
01:33:47,296 --> 01:33:49,130
Yes, she had a history of episodes.

1828
01:33:49,130 --> 01:33:51,463
But her worst episode ever
was after that night

1829
01:33:51,463 --> 01:33:53,838
when you and Reuben told everyone
she was acting delusional,

1830
01:33:53,838 --> 01:33:56,713
being very adamant that nothing
had happened between you guys.

1831
01:33:56,713 --> 01:33:59,130
[Dennis] You were the one
who got her all liquored up.

1832
01:33:59,130 --> 01:34:02,671
[Forbes] Me? Fuck you.
I gave her one drink and you kept going.

1833
01:34:02,671 --> 01:34:05,421
You gave the cops some bullshit story.
You got me expelled.

1834
01:34:05,421 --> 01:34:07,588
Then everyone saying
she was having an episode

1835
01:34:07,588 --> 01:34:09,921
actually made her have an episode,
a huge one,

1836
01:34:09,921 --> 01:34:13,463
which ultimately got her thrown into
a mental hospital under suicide watch.

1837
01:34:13,463 --> 01:34:15,713
- [Dennis] I didn't know.
- [Forbes] So I go to California,

1838
01:34:15,713 --> 01:34:18,671
and every time I come home,
it's: "Your sister's still struggling."

1839
01:34:18,671 --> 01:34:20,713
"She's aimless.
Can you help? Can you help?"

1840
01:34:20,713 --> 01:34:23,713
- So... like, yeah.
- [machine powering up]

1841
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:27,171
I showed her the machine,
thinking it would reconnect us.

1842
01:34:27,171 --> 01:34:30,421
[Dennis] Bro, you thought this machine
was gonna reconnect you two?

1843
01:34:30,421 --> 01:34:33,630
[Forbes] Yeah. At the lab, my team and I
would mainly use it to play this game,

1844
01:34:33,630 --> 01:34:35,088
like Mafia or Werewolf or whatever.

1845
01:34:35,088 --> 01:34:36,880
[Dennis] I know all about the game, bro.

1846
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,296
[Forbes] So guess what?

1847
01:34:38,296 --> 01:34:41,755
It turns out this whole time
she's just been stewing, festering,

1848
01:34:41,755 --> 01:34:42,880
waiting to get back.

1849
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,505
At you, me...

1850
01:34:49,296 --> 01:34:50,338
[distorted] ...everyone.

1851
01:34:53,213 --> 01:34:54,588
[music fades]

1852
01:34:54,588 --> 01:34:56,380
[indistinct chatter]

1853
01:34:57,671 --> 01:35:00,838
And just so I'm clear,
what happened to everybody?

1854
01:35:04,421 --> 01:35:05,755
Bro, everything got crazy.

1855
01:35:05,755 --> 01:35:06,963
[alarm buzzing]

1856
01:35:06,963 --> 01:35:09,921
[men shouting]

1857
01:35:10,838 --> 01:35:13,671
[alarm buzzing]

1858
01:35:28,255 --> 01:35:29,171
Shelby?

1859
01:35:33,921 --> 01:35:35,296
You don't recognize me?

1860
01:35:36,213 --> 01:35:39,546
I don't know who the fuck
ended up in whose body.

1861
01:35:40,171 --> 01:35:42,171
What the fuck is going on?

1862
01:35:43,963 --> 01:35:44,838
Who are you?

1863
01:35:46,463 --> 01:35:47,296
I'm Shelby.

1864
01:35:48,421 --> 01:35:50,796
Why are you being so weird, right...?

1865
01:35:50,796 --> 01:35:52,588
What's go...? Who are you? What's...

1866
01:35:52,588 --> 01:35:54,213
- Who are you, seriously?
- [Shelby] Cyrus.

1867
01:35:54,796 --> 01:35:56,671
What, are you disappointed or something?

1868
01:35:57,463 --> 01:36:01,213
[snorting] All right.
I'm in serious fucking trouble here.

1869
01:36:02,213 --> 01:36:03,088
[Shelby] I know.

1870
01:36:03,713 --> 01:36:06,671
I need you to help me.
I need you to go talk to the cops.

1871
01:36:07,546 --> 01:36:08,880
I don't know if I can.

1872
01:36:12,171 --> 01:36:13,546
Uh, you have to.

1873
01:36:15,921 --> 01:36:17,505
What the fuck? What's the vibe?

1874
01:36:17,505 --> 01:36:19,463
What's going on?
Why are you being like this?

1875
01:36:19,463 --> 01:36:22,671
- This is not fucking Shelby. Who are you?
- This is Shelby.

1876
01:36:23,171 --> 01:36:25,171
You're acting totally fucking different.

1877
01:36:25,171 --> 01:36:28,130
Are you... You're mad at me.
I'm sorry. I was...

1878
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:30,546
Do you... I mean, what if we... We could...

1879
01:36:31,463 --> 01:36:33,171
You wanna talk about getting married?

1880
01:36:33,171 --> 01:36:35,838
We could get out of here
and talk about getting married.

1881
01:36:35,838 --> 01:36:37,546
What? Are you just... Can we...

1882
01:36:37,546 --> 01:36:40,505
Maybe we can figure this out
somewhere else, you know, like...

1883
01:36:40,505 --> 01:36:43,130
[spluttering] Like... Like...

1884
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:45,296
[Shelby] I can't get you out of this one.

1885
01:36:46,296 --> 01:36:47,963
[alarm buzzing]

1886
01:36:47,963 --> 01:36:49,546
Wha-- What?

1887
01:36:51,046 --> 01:36:53,630
[Shelby] Cyrus,
you were super high last night.

1888
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:59,421
What the fuck are you talking about?

1889
01:36:59,421 --> 01:37:00,463
[tense music plays]

1890
01:37:01,546 --> 01:37:03,630
[Forbes] Everything got totally crazy.

1891
01:37:03,630 --> 01:37:05,338
What the fuck are you talking about?

1892
01:37:05,338 --> 01:37:07,338
I was supposed to go into Reuben's body,

1893
01:37:07,338 --> 01:37:09,505
but then I guess
your sister messed with some shit.

1894
01:37:09,505 --> 01:37:11,046
Yes. We're good. We're good.

1895
01:37:11,046 --> 01:37:13,671
And I guess not everyone got
what everyone wanted.

1896
01:37:13,671 --> 01:37:14,921
- [Nikki] Do it!
- [Forbes] Wait!

1897
01:37:14,921 --> 01:37:17,130
[high-pitched ringing]

1898
01:37:17,130 --> 01:37:19,338
No.

1899
01:37:19,338 --> 01:37:22,005
Oh my God, what the...
What the... What the f--

1900
01:37:22,005 --> 01:37:22,963
Wait! Wait, wait!

1901
01:37:22,963 --> 01:37:24,130
What the fuck?

1902
01:37:25,255 --> 01:37:26,255
What the fuck?

1903
01:37:26,255 --> 01:37:28,505
- No, no, no. What the--
- Fuck!

1904
01:37:28,505 --> 01:37:32,338
Like, that's Maya over there.
I know that much.

1905
01:37:34,671 --> 01:37:37,088
She thinks
she got fucking reincarnated or some shit.

1906
01:37:37,088 --> 01:37:40,505
This isn't some fucking game, okay?
I need you to help get me out of here.

1907
01:37:40,505 --> 01:37:44,630
The cops are saying someone took money
out of Dennis's account before he died

1908
01:37:44,630 --> 01:37:47,630
and transferred it
to some random offshore account.

1909
01:37:47,630 --> 01:37:50,296
- [Shelby] And what do you want me to do?
- It was Forbes!

1910
01:37:50,296 --> 01:37:52,588
Forbes was in Dennis's body
during the first round.

1911
01:37:52,588 --> 01:37:54,713
He lied and said it was me.

1912
01:37:54,713 --> 01:37:57,380
- Cyrus is in Dennis's body.
- Fine.

1913
01:37:57,380 --> 01:37:59,171
But he was in Dennis.

1914
01:38:00,671 --> 01:38:02,213
But now there's no suitcase,

1915
01:38:02,213 --> 01:38:04,296
so I guess he's just fucking gone.

1916
01:38:05,088 --> 01:38:07,088
[Beatrice] Wait. What?

1917
01:38:07,088 --> 01:38:08,630
[music ends]

1918
01:38:08,630 --> 01:38:10,130
Who has the machine now?

1919
01:38:11,755 --> 01:38:12,880
[sighs]

1920
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:15,005
[grandiose music playing]

1921
01:38:15,005 --> 01:38:15,921
[Forbes] Well...

1922
01:38:22,921 --> 01:38:25,630
[fireworks exploding]

1923
01:38:29,546 --> 01:38:33,213
Every new body you go into gives you
a new piece of the human condition...

1924
01:38:33,213 --> 01:38:35,130
[distorted] ...and then after a while,

1925
01:38:35,130 --> 01:38:37,296
you just wanna constantly switch.

1926
01:38:46,755 --> 01:38:49,088
[grandiose music builds]

1927
01:38:54,421 --> 01:38:55,338
Fuck!

1928
01:38:56,713 --> 01:38:57,546
[Forbes] Yeah.

1929
01:38:57,546 --> 01:38:59,088
[grandiose music ends]

1930
01:38:59,088 --> 01:39:01,796
Cyrus, it was a game.

1931
01:39:02,671 --> 01:39:03,588
It wasn't real.

1932
01:39:04,088 --> 01:39:05,838
[Cyrus] No, I'm not fucking cra--

1933
01:39:05,838 --> 01:39:08,338
Don't gaslight me or whatever the fuck...

1934
01:39:08,338 --> 01:39:09,338
Who are you?

1935
01:39:10,171 --> 01:39:11,171
[Shelby] I told you...

1936
01:39:13,171 --> 01:39:14,130
I'm Shelby.

1937
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:17,213
Prove it.

1938
01:39:22,505 --> 01:39:24,880
[mysterious music playing]

1939
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:29,296
Last night, you said you wanted to spend
the rest of your life with me.

1940
01:39:31,171 --> 01:39:35,213
But I didn't believe you because you've
been lying our entire relationship.

1941
01:39:36,255 --> 01:39:39,713
Then somebody came up with a good idea
of how to get the truth out of you.

1942
01:39:39,713 --> 01:39:40,796
Wanna know what I'd do

1943
01:39:40,796 --> 01:39:42,338
if I were in your shoes?

1944
01:39:42,338 --> 01:39:43,713
- What?
- We need to talk.

1945
01:39:43,713 --> 01:39:46,713
{\an8}- If what you really want is Nikki...
- Okay, what do we tell everyone?

1946
01:39:46,713 --> 01:39:48,588
[Cyrus] You said that was what you wanted!

1947
01:39:48,588 --> 01:39:51,505
{\an8}- [Shelby] I never said that.
- [Cyrus] You said we could make it work.

1948
01:39:51,505 --> 01:39:54,130
You telling me that you wanna marry me,

1949
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,338
but you actually want me

1950
01:39:56,338 --> 01:39:59,421
to spend the rest of my life
in somebody else's body,

1951
01:39:59,421 --> 01:40:02,463
is the last lie
you are ever going to tell me.

1952
01:40:03,463 --> 01:40:04,671
Oh my God.

1953
01:40:06,171 --> 01:40:08,380
Is this 'cause of the fucking wig stuff?

1954
01:40:08,921 --> 01:40:11,588
Is this seriously
'cause of the fucking wig...

1955
01:40:11,588 --> 01:40:13,880
We don't ever have to do it again.
I'm sorry.

1956
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:16,213
- Can you go talk to them, please?
- [Shelby] Cyrus?

1957
01:40:16,796 --> 01:40:18,588
What you did was wrong.

1958
01:40:19,630 --> 01:40:21,213
It was fucking wrong.

1959
01:40:22,171 --> 01:40:23,630
And you're a shitty person.

1960
01:40:24,130 --> 01:40:28,088
And you deserve to spend the rest
of your miserable existence

1961
01:40:28,088 --> 01:40:31,838
with a rusty shovel
crammed up your fucking ass.

1962
01:40:32,421 --> 01:40:34,255
So fuck on that, bitch!

1963
01:40:34,755 --> 01:40:36,463
[dramatic music playing]

1964
01:42:50,421 --> 01:42:51,880
[music fades]
