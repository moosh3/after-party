out of here in

called Mr. Donatelli,

of the matter is
I just saw red,

instead.

is entirely
at his disposal
for the honeymoon.

890
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:21,952
Hold on, Wilhelm.

891
00:50:21,986 --> 00:50:24,155
More copper!
More copper!

892
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:26,091
Don't encourage her,
Punjab!

893
00:50:26,124 --> 00:50:28,093
I'm sorry, sir.
Maybe I should
take her out.

894
00:50:28,126 --> 00:50:30,795
Good idea.
Where do you
want to go?

895
00:50:30,828 --> 00:50:33,664
To Washington,
to meet
President Roosevelt.

896
00:50:35,566 --> 00:50:37,368
How about a movie?

897
00:50:37,402 --> 00:50:39,237
Pepper went
to a movie once,

898
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:40,938
before she came
to the orphanage,

899
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:42,473
and she said
it was swell.

900
00:50:42,507 --> 00:50:44,675
And Miss Hannigan
goes all the time.

901
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:48,513
Splendid! Take her to
the Radio City Music Hall.

902
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:49,714
Aren't you gonna take me?

903
00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:51,282
(SCOFFS) Me?

904
00:50:51,316 --> 00:50:53,651
Annie, you may think
that Miss Farrell does
all the work around here,

905
00:50:53,684 --> 00:50:55,420
but it's not
entirely true.

906
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:58,022
I'm a busy man.
A very busy man.

907
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,991
I know.
I didn't mean to get
in the way, Mr. Warbucks.

908
00:51:01,025 --> 00:51:02,593
Nobody has to
take me anywhere.

909
00:51:02,627 --> 00:51:04,762
I'll go practice
my backhand.

910
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:11,969
Pepper lies a lot.

911
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:14,839
She probably hasn't
been to a movie, either.

912
00:51:15,673 --> 00:51:17,608
Actually,
I think it's better

913
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:19,810
when you don't know
what you're missing.

914
00:51:22,313 --> 00:51:26,050
Punjab,
buy out the 8:00 show.

915
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,619
Let's all go
to the movies.

916
00:51:28,653 --> 00:51:30,188
(BOTH GIGGLING)

917
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:35,993
You know, you should
leave your hair down.
It looks so pretty.

918
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:38,796
Oh, no, no, Annie.
I couldn't.
I just couldn't.

919
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:41,232
Miss Hannigan says
a man don't look at
your brains.

920
00:51:41,266 --> 00:51:44,735
Oh, really?
My goodness!
Come on, Annie.

921
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:46,571
Let's go
to the movies.

922
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:47,972
Let's go see the stars.

923
00:51:48,005 --> 00:51:49,840
Yeah.

924
00:51:49,874 --> 00:51:54,179
* Cowboy heroes
Cops and robbers

925
00:51:54,212 --> 00:51:56,281
* Glamour and strife

926
00:51:56,314 --> 00:51:58,082
* Bigger than life

927
00:52:02,587 --> 00:52:06,924
* Sitting in the darkness

928
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:11,196
* What a world to see

929
00:52:11,229 --> 00:52:14,332
* Let's go
to the movies

930
00:52:14,365 --> 00:52:19,704
* Annie, wait and see

931
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:23,874
* Bette Davis
is probably lying

932
00:52:23,908 --> 00:52:26,311
* And Greta Garbo
is probably crying

933
00:52:26,344 --> 00:52:30,515
* While Robert Taylor is
locked in her dying embrace

934
00:52:30,548 --> 00:52:35,052
* Chico and Groucho
and Chaplin and Lloyd
are all super

935
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,954
* Sweet Mickey Mouse
Shirley Temple

936
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,256
* And dear Jackie Cooper

937
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:42,126
* Let's go
to the movies

938
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:46,130
BOTH: * Let's go see the stars

939
00:52:50,768 --> 00:52:54,939
* Fred and Ginger
Spinning madly

940
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:16,794
* Anything you can imagine

941
00:53:19,297 --> 00:53:21,466
* Songs and romance

942
00:53:21,499 --> 00:53:23,634
* Life is a dance

943
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:30,841
* Sitting in the darkness

944
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:35,413
* Popcorn on your knee

945
00:53:35,446 --> 00:53:39,750
* Give the maid
the night off

946
00:53:40,851 --> 00:53:42,887
Turn the kitchen
light off!

947
00:53:44,389 --> 00:53:48,859
* Let's go to the movies,
Annie

948
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:52,797
* You and me

949
00:54:21,326 --> 00:54:25,229
* Welcome to the movies

950
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,966
* Welcome to the stars

951
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:32,737
* Welcome to this
grand illusion

952
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,605
* All of it's yours

953
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:36,774
* Right through these doors

954
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:42,146
* Every plot's a dilly

955
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:45,916
* This we guarantee

956
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:49,620
* Welcome to the movies

957
00:54:49,654 --> 00:54:53,023
* Wait and see

958
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:15,245
* Let's go to the movies

959
00:55:15,279 --> 00:55:19,650
* Let's go see the stars

960
00:55:19,684 --> 00:55:22,152
* Headlines holler

961
00:55:22,186 --> 00:55:24,088
* Big Depression

962
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:26,256
* What do we care?

963
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:28,526
* Movies are there

964
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:33,230
* Only happy endings
Boy gets girl

965
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:37,368
* That's our recipe

966
00:55:37,402 --> 00:55:40,671
* Welcome to our lovely

967
00:55:40,705 --> 00:55:45,009
* M-O-V-I-E

968
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:20,611
* We love to go to RKO

969
00:56:20,645 --> 00:56:24,048
* Columbia, Universal

970
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:27,351
* Jack Warner
and Sam Goldwyn

971
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:29,920
* And MGM and Zanuck

972
00:56:29,954 --> 00:56:31,021
* Here's to

973
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:33,491
* Dreams of glory

974
00:56:33,524 --> 00:56:36,260
* Casts of thousands

975
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:40,998
* Bigger than life

976
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,870
* Bigger than life

977
00:56:48,573 --> 00:56:53,911
* Only happy endings

978
00:56:55,646 --> 00:57:00,985
* That's our recipe

979
00:57:01,018 --> 00:57:07,191
* So welcome to the movies

980
00:57:08,993 --> 00:57:11,662
* Wait

981
00:57:11,696 --> 00:57:14,298
* And

982
00:57:14,331 --> 00:57:16,834
* See

983
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:37,187
For the Lady
of the Camellias.

984
00:57:39,924 --> 00:57:43,227
And they're almost
twice as large as usual.

985
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:46,363
I shall have
twice as many
as usual tomorrow.

986
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:47,598
Twice as ma...

987
00:57:47,632 --> 00:57:49,567
Oh, don't listen
to her, Barjon.

988
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,001
I know what
those things cost.

989
00:57:51,035 --> 00:57:52,402
Aren't you willing
to listen to her

990
00:57:52,436 --> 00:57:54,539
when she orders her caps
and dresses from you?

991
00:57:54,572 --> 00:57:56,273
They're an investment.

992
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,675
You won't be
young forever.

993
00:57:57,708 --> 00:58:01,512
It's high time you settle
something about your future.

994
00:58:01,546 --> 00:58:04,682
And I know
the very man for you.

995
00:58:04,715 --> 00:58:05,750
MARGUERITE: Really?

996
00:58:05,783 --> 00:58:06,884
WOMAN: Yes, really.

997
00:58:09,854 --> 00:58:12,523
No one has
ever loved you
as I love you.

998
00:58:12,557 --> 00:58:16,694
Well, it might be true.
But what can I do about it?

999
00:58:16,727 --> 00:58:19,530
You should go away
and not see me anymore.

1000
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,903
But don't go in anger.

1001
00:58:25,936 --> 00:58:27,938
Now,
why don't you laugh
at yourself a little,

1002
00:58:27,972 --> 00:58:30,975
as I laugh at myself,
and come talk to me
once in a while

1003
00:58:31,742 --> 00:58:34,111
in a friendly way.

1004
00:58:34,144 --> 00:58:36,313
ARMAND: That's too much
and not enough.

1005
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,849
Believe in love,
Marguerite.

1006
00:58:38,883 --> 00:58:40,618
So you do love him?

1007
00:58:43,087 --> 00:58:45,222
Dare to tell me
that you love him,

1008
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:47,457
and you're free
of me forever.

1009
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:50,494
I love him.

1010
00:58:56,133 --> 00:58:59,303
Come in.
Come in here,
all of you.

1011
00:58:59,336 --> 00:59:00,871
See this woman?
You know her.

1012
00:59:00,905 --> 00:59:03,473
Then listen to what
I'm going to say.
Armand.

1013
00:59:03,507 --> 00:59:05,943
I accepted her favors
because I thought
she loved me.

1014
00:59:05,976 --> 00:59:07,444
I let her make
sacrifices for me

1015
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:09,146
when there were others
who had more to give.

1016
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:12,382
But bear witness,
I owe her nothing.

1017
00:59:12,416 --> 00:59:14,518
Take it.
Go on. Take it.

1018
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,821
Buy camellias.
Buy diamonds,
horses and carriages.

1019
00:59:16,854 --> 00:59:19,389
Buy moonlight.
Buy a grave!

1020
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,291
MAN: I congratulate you,
monsieur.

1021
00:59:21,325 --> 00:59:23,127
You know how to treat
a woman as she deserves.

1022
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,795
Like the cheat this one is.

1023
00:59:31,736 --> 00:59:33,604
Marguerite.

1024
00:59:33,638 --> 00:59:34,905
(WEAKLY) Armand.

1025
00:59:34,939 --> 00:59:36,306
Marguerite!

1026
00:59:39,677 --> 00:59:41,612
Oh, it's you.

1027
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,282
ARMAND: I've been
down in the street
half the night,

1028
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:46,651
walking back and forth
under your window,

1029
00:59:46,684 --> 00:59:48,518
just as I did
when I first knew you,

1030
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:51,021
wanting to come up,
but not daring to.

1031
00:59:51,055 --> 00:59:52,690
I felt so guilty.

1032
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:56,727
Don't think such things,
Marguerite.

1033
00:59:56,761 --> 00:59:59,296
Even if we can't go
to the country today,

1034
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:01,732
think of how happy
we were once,

1035
01:00:01,766 --> 01:00:04,334
and how happy
we shall be again.

1036
01:00:04,368 --> 01:00:06,003
Think of the day you found
the four-leaf clover,

1037
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:08,639
and of all the good luck
it's going to bring us.

1038
01:00:08,673 --> 01:00:11,642
Think of the vows we heard
Nichette and Gustave make.

1039
01:00:11,676 --> 01:00:14,679
And that we're going to make,
to each other.

1040
01:00:14,712 --> 01:00:16,947
This is for life,
Marguerite.

1041
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:21,618
Marguerite.

1042
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:28,325
Marguerite.

1043
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:31,528
No.

1044
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:33,698
No, don't leave me!

1045
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:35,599
Marguerite, come back.

1046
01:00:55,185 --> 01:00:56,553
(SNIFFLING)

1047
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:53,778
Could you get her nightgown?
It's behind the bathroom door.

1048
01:01:53,811 --> 01:01:55,579
Certainly.
Certainly.

1049
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:33,117
Miss Farrell...

1050
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:34,885
No, no, no.
It's all right.

1051
01:02:36,653 --> 01:02:38,122
How did you
learn that?

1052
01:02:38,155 --> 01:02:39,689
Learn what?
That.

1053
01:02:39,723 --> 01:02:40,958
What?

1054
01:02:40,991 --> 01:02:42,592
You put her to bed.

1055
01:02:42,626 --> 01:02:44,028
Well,
you put her
to bed, too.

1056
01:02:44,061 --> 01:02:46,330
I did?
Yes, you did.

1057
01:02:46,363 --> 01:02:47,832
Good heavens.
(CHUCKLES)

1058
01:03:10,587 --> 01:03:13,757
That was a wonderful evening
you gave her last night, sir.
Just wonderful.

1059
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:16,894
I gonna have to close
a factory in Pittsburgh,
Miss Farrell.

1060
01:03:16,927 --> 01:03:17,962
About Annie...

1061
01:03:17,995 --> 01:03:19,830
What about Annie?

1062
01:03:19,864 --> 01:03:21,698
Could we keep her?

1063
01:03:23,067 --> 01:03:24,835
You haven't seen
that horrible orphanage.

1064
01:03:24,869 --> 01:03:28,172

01:13:02,679 --> 01:13:03,747
What took you
so long?

1242
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:06,516
What's happening
around here?
Where's Annie?

1243
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:09,719
She's taking her
karate lesson
with the Asp.

1244
01:13:09,753 --> 01:13:10,887
GRACE: Oh, Oliver,
don't be nervous.

1245
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,321
Nervous?
I'm not nervous.

1246
01:13:12,355 --> 01:13:13,557
No, you give it
to her.

1247
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:15,124
No, no, Oliver,
it was your idea.

1248
01:13:15,158 --> 01:13:16,926
She likes you better
than she likes me.

1249
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:19,328
Oliver, will you
pull yourself together.

1250
01:13:19,362 --> 01:13:21,264
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

1251
01:13:26,302 --> 01:13:30,139
Oh, Mr. Warbucks, want to see
what the Asp taught me today?

1252
01:13:30,173 --> 01:13:31,407

1254
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:36,980
To the couch, Punjab,
if you please.

1255
01:13:37,013 --> 01:13:39,516
Oh, gee,
I didn't think
it would work.

1256
01:13:39,549 --> 01:13:40,984
Well, now you
know it does, ha.

1257
01:13:41,017 --> 01:13:43,352
Should I call a doctor?
Oh, it'll be fine.

1258
01:13:44,187 --> 01:13:45,388
Punjab.

1259
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,765
Thank you.

1260
01:13:55,799 --> 01:13:57,333
(SIGHS)

1261
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:01,270
We'll leave
you two alone.

1262
01:14:13,049 --> 01:14:16,953
Annie, I wanna talk to you
about something very serious.

1263
01:14:18,254 --> 01:14:20,824
You don't want me
anymore, right?

1264
01:14:20,857 --> 01:14:23,059
On the contrary, I do.

1265
01:14:23,092 --> 01:14:24,994
Good Lord!

1266
01:14:25,028 --> 01:14:28,565
Annie, can we have
a man-to-man talk?

1267
01:14:28,598 --> 01:14:30,333
Sure.

1268
01:14:30,366 --> 01:14:35,505
What I'm proposing would
involve a long-term, uh,
well, agreement.

1269
01:14:35,539 --> 01:14:38,775
Actually,
maybe you ought to
know more about me

1270
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:41,110
before you
make up your mind.

1271
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:42,178
Okay.

1272
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:44,848
Let's, uh,
let's go for a walk.

1273
01:14:44,881 --> 01:14:45,982
Okay.

1274
01:14:48,384 --> 01:14:52,221
I was born in Liverpool
in a railroad switch-house.

1275
01:14:52,255 --> 01:14:54,290
My younger brother
died of pneumonia

1276
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:57,160
because we didn't have
money for medicine.

1277
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:02,465
Well, I decided then and there
that one day I would be rich,

1278
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,900
very, very rich.

1279
01:15:03,933 --> 01:15:05,268
Good idea.

1280
01:15:05,301 --> 01:15:08,538
In those days,
America was the
land of opportunity.

1281
01:15:08,572 --> 01:15:12,075
I signed on a ship as
cabin boy when I was 12.

1282
01:15:12,108 --> 01:15:16,245
By the time I was 21,
I'd made my first million.

1283
01:15:16,279 --> 01:15:18,982
In the next 10 years,
I turned that into
100 million.

1284
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:20,183
Wow.
Hmm.

1285
01:15:20,216 --> 01:15:22,686
In those days,
that was a lot of money.

1286
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:25,722
I was ruthless,
hurt a lot of people.

1287
01:15:25,755 --> 01:15:30,459
Making money was all I ever
gave a damn about, up to now.

1288
01:15:32,996 --> 01:15:34,497
Let's go inside.

1289
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:35,632
Okay.

1290
01:15:39,302 --> 01:15:41,938
It's occurred to me
that no matter how
many houses I have,

1291
01:15:41,971 --> 01:15:44,774
how many Rembrandts,
how many Duesenbergs,

1292
01:15:44,808 --> 01:15:46,676
that unless I have
someone to share it with,

1293
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:51,080
well, I might as well be
back in Liverpool, broke.

1294
01:15:51,114 --> 01:15:53,182
Annie, do you understand
what I'm trying to say?

1295
01:15:53,216 --> 01:15:54,550
Sure.
Good.

1296
01:15:55,919 --> 01:15:56,953
Kind of.

1297
01:15:56,986 --> 01:15:58,554
Kind of?

1298
01:15:58,588 --> 01:15:59,689
I guess not.

1299
01:15:59,723 --> 01:16:00,824
Damn!

1300
01:16:00,857 --> 01:16:02,358
Oh, excuse me.

1301
01:16:11,334 --> 01:16:13,569
You've given me so much
already, Mr. Warbucks.

1302
01:16:13,603 --> 01:16:15,972
I got the papers signed
today. It's official.

1303
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,074
What is?

1304
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:23,446
It's so pretty, but...

1305
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:25,448
Let me put it on you.
No.

1306
01:16:26,816 --> 01:16:29,318
It's a really
swell locket,
Mr. Warbucks.

1307
01:16:29,352 --> 01:16:32,255
But if it's
all the same to you,
I'll keep my old one.

1308
01:16:32,288 --> 01:16:34,390
It isn't
all the same to me.
Your old one's broken.

1309
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:36,826
This one's engraved.
You didn't even look at it.

1310
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:42,565
"To Annie, with love,
from Daddy Warbucks."

1311
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:45,835
Mr. Warbucks,
when my folks left
me at the orphanage

1312
01:16:45,869 --> 01:16:48,404
10 years ago,
they left a note

1313
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:52,341
saying that
they'd come back to get
me as soon as they could.

1314
01:16:52,375 --> 01:16:55,178
And they kept
the other half
of this old locket

1315
01:16:55,211 --> 01:16:57,313
so I'd know them
when they came.

1316
01:16:57,346 --> 01:16:59,849
I'm gonna find them
someday, Mr. Warbucks.

1317
01:16:59,883 --> 01:17:01,951
I'm gonna
have a regular
mother and father,

1318
01:17:01,985 --> 01:17:04,287
like a regular kid.
I am.

1319
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:09,625
I don't mean to
hurt your feelings.

1320
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:13,663
You've been
nicer to me than anybody
in the whole wide world,

1321
01:17:13,697 --> 01:17:16,065
but I've been
dreaming of my folks

1322
01:17:16,099 --> 01:17:18,401
for as long
as I can remember,

1323
01:17:18,434 --> 01:17:20,536
and I just
got to find them.

1324
01:17:26,275 --> 01:17:27,944
And I'll help you.

1325
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:36,419
Grace, get me
J. Edgar on the phone!

1326
01:17:36,452 --> 01:17:39,388
