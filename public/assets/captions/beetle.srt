1
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:44,925
Oh, that's a big fella.

2
00:02:45,103 --> 00:02:46,764
Whoal

3
00:03:13,214 --> 00:03:15,375
- Looks great.
- Thank you.

4
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,586
- Happy vacation, honey.
- Ooh_

5
00:03:19,011 --> 00:03:21,798
Manchurian tung oil.
Where did you get this?

6
00:03:21,973 --> 00:03:23,634
Helen got it for me in Oslo.

7
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,469
Well, there's enough here
to do the whole table and the bureau.

8
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:29,761
Hmm.

9
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:31,679
I wonder what this could be.

10
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:36,602
- Oh, honey, you got it. Thank you.
- Enough there to do the entire guest room.

11
00:03:36,779 --> 00:03:39,065
I'm so glad we're spending
our vacation at home.

12
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,027
- I'm gonna get started right away.
- Well, hey, where are you going?

13
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:48,162
- I'll get it.
- Be my guest.

14
00:03:48,332 --> 00:03:49,538
I'll just get the...

15
00:03:52,837 --> 00:03:54,277
- Maybe you should get it.
- I'll go.

16
00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:55,748
Okay. No!

17
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:02,794
Oh, no.

18
00:04:07,393 --> 00:04:10,556
Ugh, Jane.

19
00:04:11,898 --> 00:04:13,854
It's your turn, honey.

20
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:28,953
Good luck. Thanks.

21
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:31,910
Hi, Barbara. “Hi

22
00:04:32,084 --> 00:04:33,915
glad I caught you.
Heard you were on vacation.

23
00:04:34,086 --> 00:04:35,542
That's right. Complete vacation.

24
00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:39,547
- Honey, today I'm $260,000.
- No, Jane.

25
00:04:39,717 --> 00:04:42,584
- It's 6:45 in the morning.
- This offer is real.

26
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:46,050
From a man in New York City
who only saw a photograph.

27
00:04:46,224 --> 00:04:48,886
Jane, don't send people
photos of our house.

28
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,303
He wants to bring the wife and family
up here for some peace and quiet.

29
00:04:53,481 --> 00:04:55,187
That's exactly what we're looking for.

30
00:04:55,358 --> 00:04:57,189
But, Barbara, this house
is too big for you.

31
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,851
It really ought to be
for a couple with a family, you know...?

32
00:05:01,489 --> 00:05:04,981
Oh, pumpkin, I didn't mean anything.
It's just that this house is too big.

33
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:07,195
- I'll see you in a few weeks. Okay?
- Okay.

34
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,530
- All right.
- Think about it.

35
00:05:08,704 --> 00:05:09,739
Barbara: Take care.

36
00:05:20,716 --> 00:05:21,751
Boo!

37
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,093
- I was just telling Barbara about this offer...
- No, Jane.

38
00:05:25,263 --> 00:05:27,003
Adam.

39
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,221
Barbara, come with me
down to the store.

40
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,266
- What for?
- I need a new brush for this tung oil.

41
00:05:39,443 --> 00:05:43,106
- And I want to get a part for the model.
- Well, you just run in, okay?

42
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:05,041
Adam: Two weeks at home.
The perfect vacation.

43
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:08,302
Barbara: Jane says we should
sell the house to someone with a family.

44
00:06:08,472 --> 00:06:12,010
Well, I don't think that
it's any of Jane's business.

45
00:06:12,435 --> 00:06:15,347
Besides, we could try again
on this vacation, you know.

46
00:06:15,521 --> 00:06:18,137
Oh, really”? What are you saying?

47
00:06:35,374 --> 00:06:38,036
Adam: How are you doing, Ernie?
Ernie: Hi, how are you?

48
00:06:47,261 --> 00:06:48,341
Morning, Adam.

49
00:06:48,512 --> 00:06:50,844
- Need a haircut before your vacation?
- No, thanks, bill.

50
00:06:51,015 --> 00:06:52,721
- How's the model coming?
- Oh, it's great.

51
00:06:52,892 --> 00:06:58,478
You know, you said bozman built that
foundation in 1835. But his grandson...

52
00:07:07,615 --> 00:07:10,778
He got hair right down
to his goddamn shoulders.

53
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:14,069
He says to me, "just trim it a little.”

54
00:07:14,246 --> 00:07:17,579
- I took the scissors to him so fast...
- See you later, huh, bill?

55
00:07:19,794 --> 00:07:21,625
Bill: Right.

56
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,590
This is gonna be great.

57
00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:35,882
Are you sure you wouldn't rather go
to Jamaica or someplace like that?

58
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,660
- No way. There's no place like home.
- Hey, look out for that...!

59
00:08:24,275 --> 00:08:26,607
Barbara:
Perfect start to our vacation.

60
00:08:26,777 --> 00:08:29,689
Well, you'll feel better
when you're dry, honey.

61
00:08:31,532 --> 00:08:34,274
Barbara:
That fire wasn't burning when we left.

62
00:08:35,202 --> 00:08:38,820
- How's your arm?
- I don't know. It feels frozen.

63
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,552
I'll make some coffee
and you get wood for the fire.

64
00:08:58,726 --> 00:09:01,468
Maybe we should just take things
extra slow.

65
00:09:01,645 --> 00:09:04,603
Do you remember how
we got back up here?

66
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:09,938
I'm gonna go back down to the bridge
and retrace our steps.

67
00:09:24,752 --> 00:09:26,242
You saved my... two hours.

68
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,004
- Barbara, you are not gonna believe... what?
- That's how long you were gone.

69
00:09:31,258 --> 00:09:34,091
- What is going on?
- I have to show you something.

70
00:09:35,638 --> 00:09:36,798
I ook.

71
00:09:44,772 --> 00:09:46,262
There's that

72
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:48,480
and there's that

73
00:09:56,117 --> 00:09:59,359
- "Handbook for the recently diseased.”
- Deceased.

74
00:10:01,956 --> 00:10:03,321
"Deceased ”

75
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:07,162
I don't know where it came from.
Look at the publisher.

76
00:10:11,173 --> 00:10:14,381
"Handbook for
the recently deceased press."

77
00:10:14,552 --> 00:10:18,465
You know what?
I don't think we survived the crash.

78
00:10:22,768 --> 00:10:23,883
I hate this.

79
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:26,973
Just... can you give me the basics?

80
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:29,935
Well, this book isn't arranged that way.
What do you wanna know?

81
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:33,567
Well, why did you disappear
when you stepped off the porch?

82
00:10:33,737 --> 00:10:36,194
Are we halfway to heaven,
are we halfway to hell?

83
00:10:36,365 --> 00:10:38,356
And how long is this gonna last?

84
00:10:38,534 --> 00:10:40,570
I don't see anything about heaven or hell.

85
00:10:40,744 --> 00:10:43,577
This book reads like stereo instructions.
Listen to this:

86
00:10:43,747 --> 00:10:45,612
"Geographical and temporal perimeters.

87
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:49,409
Functional perimeters vary from
manifestation to manifestation.”

88
00:10:51,088 --> 00:10:52,749
Oh, this is gonna take some time, honey.

89
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:19,484
Damn sandworms. Thirteen percent, huh?

90
00:11:19,658 --> 00:11:23,116
Well, I better find a job.
I et's see. Business section.

91
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:28,868
Ooh-la-la.

92
00:11:29,043 --> 00:11:31,625
What do we got here?
The maitlands, huh?

93
00:11:33,631 --> 00:11:37,123
Cute couple. Look nice and stupid too.

94
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:46,720
I wish I had a better view
of the cemetery from here.

95
00:11:46,894 --> 00:11:49,806
I can't tell which is
the best placement for us.

96
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:56,809
Cabin fever, hon?

97
00:11:56,987 --> 00:11:58,602
Well, I can't clean anything properly.

98
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:01,739
The vacuum"s out in the garage
and we can't leave the house.

99
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:04,992
Why don't they tell us something?
Where are all the other dead people?

100
00:12:05,162 --> 00:12:07,153
Why is it just you and me?

101
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,496
Maybe this is heaven.

102
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:12,995
In heaven there wouldn't be dust
on everything.

103
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:23,509
Adam: It's Jane.

104
00:12:27,518 --> 00:12:32,262
Barbara: God, what's she doing here?
- I don't know. Hey, Jane, up here. Jane.

105
00:12:37,987 --> 00:12:40,603
- Can't see you, right?
- Uh-uh.

106
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:45,529
In the book, rule number two:
"The living usually won't see the dead."

107
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,242
- Won't or can't?
- It just says "won't."

108
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:54,409
God, this book is so stupid.
I can't understand anything in there.

109
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,460
Barb, honey...

110
00:12:58,048 --> 00:12:59,709
We're dead.

111
00:12:59,883 --> 00:13:03,341
I don't think we have very much
to worry about anymore.

112
00:13:27,578 --> 00:13:28,909
Barbara: Aah!

113
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:39,583
Man 1: Ah, this is great.
This is just what the doctor ordered.

114
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:46,840
Sorry, ma'am.

115
00:13:49,266 --> 00:13:52,258
Delia deetz, welcome home.

116
00:13:52,436 --> 00:13:53,801
Charles.

117
00:13:54,313 --> 00:13:56,599
It's okay, there's no damage.
Look, see? It's okay.

118
00:13:56,774 --> 00:13:59,106
Good, sturdy, country craftsmanship.

119
00:13:59,276 --> 00:14:00,937
And look at that kitchen.

120
00:14:01,111 --> 00:14:03,944
You're finally gonna be able
to cook a decent meal

121
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,156
come and have a look.

122
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,249
A little gasoline. Blowtorch. No problem.

123
00:14:21,423 --> 00:14:23,755
Excuse me. Down we go.

124
00:14:34,978 --> 00:14:36,969
Charles:
We'll have to rip out all the plumbing.

125
00:14:37,147 --> 00:14:40,264
But other than that, it's perfect.
Just perfect.

126
00:14:41,318 --> 00:14:44,276
What do you think, honey?
Delia hates it.

127
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,110
I could live here.

128
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,116
Careful. That's my sculpture.

129
00:14:51,286 --> 00:14:55,370
I don't mean "my" as in "I bought it."
I mean I made it. It's my sculpture.

130
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,491
Put it on the table.

131
00:15:06,802 --> 00:15:09,919
Ten minutes.
I'm already perfectly at ease.

132
00:15:10,556 --> 00:15:11,591
It's perfect.

133
00:15:12,975 --> 00:15:15,808
Man 2: Help! - It's otho

134
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:19,095
Charles: Otho, why don't you just
come in the front?

135
00:15:19,857 --> 00:15:21,017
It's bad luck.

136
00:15:21,191 --> 00:15:24,103
Otho, you left the city for me.
I am so happy.

137
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:26,234
Of course you are.

138
00:15:27,698 --> 00:15:28,778
- Delia.
- You're right.

139
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:30,860
- Let's get one thing straight.
- You're right.

140
00:15:31,034 --> 00:15:33,150
- We're here to enjoy the country setting...
- Mm-hm_

141
00:15:33,328 --> 00:15:35,034
- Not to trash the place.
- You're right.

142
00:15:35,205 --> 00:15:37,787
Otho: Charles, you're lucky
the yuppies are buying condos...

143
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:41,371
So you can afford what I'm going
to have to do to this place.

144
00:15:41,545 --> 00:15:46,630
Otho, I'm here to relax and clip coupons,
and, damn it, I mean to do it.

145
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,382
Then go do it quietly, dear,
and let otho and I think.

146
00:15:49,553 --> 00:15:51,635
Otho:
Is the rest of the house as bad as this?

147
00:15:52,055 --> 00:15:54,671
Is this a punishment or something?

148
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,215
What are we gonna do?

149
00:15:57,311 --> 00:15:59,723
We're not completely helpless, Barbara.

150
00:15:59,897 --> 00:16:03,856
I've been reading that book and there's
a word for people in our situation.

151
00:16:04,568 --> 00:16:06,183
(Hosts.

152
00:16:07,613 --> 00:16:10,355
Otho:
Delia, let's get this show on the road.

153
00:16:13,118 --> 00:16:15,279
We're dealing with
negative entertainment potential.

154
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:18,161
I mean, there's absolutely
no organic flow-through.

155
00:16:18,332 --> 00:16:21,950
I noticed that too.
It's like a giant ant farm.

156
00:16:24,421 --> 00:16:27,037
- What?
- I thought I saw something.

157
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,885
Otho: You've read my mind.

158
00:16:41,063 --> 00:16:43,896
- I did?
- So few clients are able to read my mind.

159
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:46,603
They're just not open to the experience.

160
00:16:47,027 --> 00:16:48,358
Hmm.

161
00:16:55,369 --> 00:16:56,404
My god.

162
00:16:56,578 --> 00:16:59,991
We just have to pray the other closets
are bigger than this one.

163
00:17:00,165 --> 00:17:02,326
Ooh, look.

164
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:05,246
Ozzie and Harriet.

165
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,751
Ugh.

166
00:17:07,422 --> 00:17:09,378
- What happened to these people?
- They died.

167
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,586
Oh, look, an indoor outhouse.

168
00:17:15,472 --> 00:17:17,713
Otho. Viridian.

169
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:20,303
Viridian. Now, why do I know that name?

170
00:17:20,477 --> 00:17:22,308
Blue-green.

171
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:24,811
Hydrated chromic oxide.

172
00:17:24,982 --> 00:17:28,395
Remember, I'm schooled in chemistry.
I was a hair analyst.

173
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:30,855
- What?
- Briefly.

174
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:38,655
Yuck. Deliver me from l.L bean.

175
00:17:39,246 --> 00:17:40,611
Boo! Aah!

176
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:43,531
I know what you two are up to
and you're not gonna get away with it.

177
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:45,825
Oh, honey, this is not working out at all.

178
00:17:46,003 --> 00:17:49,666
Charles, I will not stop living and breathing
art just because you need to relax.

179
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,875
Ha

180
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:53,415
Delia: I'm here.
I will live with you in this hellhole.

181
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:57,553
But I must express myself.
If you don't let me gut out this house...

182
00:17:57,723 --> 00:18:02,433
And make it my own, I will go insane
and I will take you with me!

183
00:18:04,354 --> 00:18:07,687
Yeah. Well, you know, maybe the house
could use a little remodeling.

184
00:18:07,858 --> 00:18:11,771
Uh, but why don't you just leave
this room alone, okay?

185
00:18:12,362 --> 00:18:13,568
Okay.

186
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:20,818
I'm gonna get her.

187
00:18:21,371 --> 00:18:22,406
So?

188
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:25,368
Once you cover up the wallpaper,
knock down a few walls

189
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:27,078
this place might just be livable.

190
00:18:27,252 --> 00:18:30,164
- What's on the third floor?
- Attic space.

191
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:32,421
Oh, I forgot to lock the attic door.

192
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:42,385
Did you feel something? “When?

193
00:18:51,735 --> 00:18:54,693
- You don't have a key?
- Maybe Charles does.

194
00:18:54,863 --> 00:18:58,902
I have a feeling there's something
very interesting behind this door.

195
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:02,864
Yeah, ghosts of the people who died in
this house, and they want us out of here.

196
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:05,245
So let's do them a favor.

197
00:19:22,057 --> 00:19:24,764
My god, that was close.

198
00:19:25,852 --> 00:19:28,264
Barbara: I cannot watch this.

199
00:19:28,438 --> 00:19:31,350
What's the good of being a ghost
if you can't frighten people away?

200
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:34,358
- Honey.
- No, I'm not putting up with this.

201
00:19:44,204 --> 00:19:47,037
- Barbara, you don't know what's out there.
- I don't care.

202
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,289
Adam: Barbara!

203
00:19:53,714 --> 00:19:54,920
Barbara: Adam.

204
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,706
- Adam?
- Barbara.

205
00:19:57,884 --> 00:19:59,795
Barbara: Adam!

206
00:20:00,595 --> 00:20:02,301
- Adam. Oh, help.
- Barbara.

207
00:20:02,472 --> 00:20:03,962
Help, I'm getting all yellow.

208
00:20:32,753 --> 00:20:34,084
Adam!

209
00:20:41,428 --> 00:20:43,134
Oh, Adam.

210
00:20:44,055 --> 00:20:46,967
We're trapped in this house
with those people.

211
00:20:52,022 --> 00:20:55,014
I can't believe we're eating cantonese.
Is there no sichuan up here?

212
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:59,519
Plan to have a stroke from the amount
of msg that's in this food.

213
00:21:00,238 --> 00:21:01,899
This 1s our first meal in this house.

214
00:21:02,073 --> 00:21:05,611
So why don't we all do our little
private parts to make it a pleasant one?

215
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:07,902
Don't bait your mother, pumpkin.

216
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:12,038
Soon as we get settled, we'll build you
a darkroom in the basement, okay?

217
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:14,370
My whole life is a darkroom.

218
00:21:15,128 --> 00:21:18,666
One big dark room.

219
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,501
So you were miserable
in New York City...

220
00:21:20,675 --> 00:21:23,382
And now you're going to be miserable
out here in the sticks.

221
00:21:23,553 --> 00:21:25,544
At least someone's life
hasn't been upheaved.

222
00:21:25,722 --> 00:21:28,054
I'm perfectly happy here.
Those people in New York...

223
00:21:28,225 --> 00:21:30,216
They just don't know
what they're missing.

224
00:21:34,689 --> 00:21:37,180
You know, we could become
the summer art center of New York.

225
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:40,351
I could start sculpting again.
I'm only truly happy when I'm sculpting.

226
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:44,397
That's a very good idea.
That'll be, um, ahem, very time-consuming.

227
00:21:44,574 --> 00:21:46,986
First the house.
Otho and I have some great plans.

228
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,071
I think we should keep it the way it is.

229
00:21:49,246 --> 00:21:51,157
(Ood idea.

230
00:21:55,752 --> 00:21:59,085
Furniture truck is coming. We're gonna
have to decide what goes and what stays.

231
00:21:59,256 --> 00:22:01,668
Everything goes,
along with whatever's in the attic.

232
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,602
Put it up. Come on.

233
00:22:19,776 --> 00:22:21,266
Careful.

234
00:22:21,444 --> 00:22:25,107
You see, if you tell me what you do
I'll tell you why my husband will fire you.

235
00:22:26,408 --> 00:22:29,195
- Isn't there an index or something?
- No, nothing.

236
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:30,575
All right, now.

237
00:22:31,288 --> 00:22:32,869
What's this?

238
00:22:36,626 --> 00:22:38,742
Delia: No, no, I'm sorry.
That does not go there.

239
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,627
Do you know where that's going?
Did anyone tell you where to...?

240
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:44,790
Why are there only three sculptures?
There were four sculptures here.

241
00:22:44,968 --> 00:22:46,879
Where's the fourth sculpture? No!

242
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:49,044
No, what are you doing?

243
00:22:49,222 --> 00:22:51,383
Efxcuse me. Put it down.

244
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:57,477
"Betelgeuse, the bio-exorcist.
Troubled by the living?

245
00:22:57,647 --> 00:23:00,309
Is death a problem and not the solution?
Unhappy with eternity?

246
00:23:00,483 --> 00:23:03,316
Having difficulty adjusting?
Call betelgeuse."

247
00:23:04,988 --> 00:23:06,628
Delia: Put it down.
- Betelgeu... betel...

248
00:23:06,781 --> 00:23:08,817
That's it?
There's no number or instructions?

249
00:23:08,992 --> 00:23:11,483
Nothing. The "bio-exorcist."
I don't get it.

250
00:23:15,582 --> 00:23:17,462
Delia: Would you put that down?
- Straight back.

251
00:23:17,626 --> 00:23:19,162
Delia:
Why is that still up there?

252
00:23:20,253 --> 00:23:22,835
Why don't you guys take a break
for about half an hour, okay?

253
00:23:23,006 --> 00:23:24,337
Man: Uh-huh.

254
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:43,473
Jesus Christ!

255
00:23:43,652 --> 00:23:45,392
Delia:
What are you doing? Put that down.

256
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,652
What the hell are you doing out there?

257
00:23:47,822 --> 00:23:50,188
Delia: Listen to me. No! Jesus.

258
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:54,785
Why are you doing this to me?
This is my art and it is dangerous.

259
00:23:54,955 --> 00:23:56,820
Do you think I want to die like this?

260
00:24:10,887 --> 00:24:13,879
- No, no.
- Hi. How are you?

261
00:24:22,232 --> 00:24:24,393
That little girl saw us.

262
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:27,643
- Honey, nobody can see us.
- But she did.

263
00:24:29,864 --> 00:24:32,446
- What happened to the previous owners?
- They drowned.

264
00:24:32,617 --> 00:24:35,575
Yes, they were family. I was devastated.

265
00:24:35,745 --> 00:24:38,031
- Here, take that.
- Is this the key to the attic?

266
00:24:38,206 --> 00:24:41,243
That's a skeleton key.
That key will open any door in the house.

267
00:24:41,418 --> 00:24:42,658
Give that to your father.

268
00:24:42,836 --> 00:24:45,999
And you might mention that I
single-handedly decorated that house.

269
00:24:46,172 --> 00:24:50,381
In case he needs any advice in that arena,
have him come see me.

270
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:12,567
Don't worry. I locked the door.

271
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:34,297
Having trouble with the living?
You tired of having your home violated?

272
00:25:34,471 --> 00:25:36,712
You want to get rid of them
pesky living critters?

273
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:40,803
Well, come on down and see me, folks,
I'm the afterlife's leading bio-exorcist.

274
00:25:40,977 --> 00:25:45,061
Yes, sirree. Come on down here
and I want to tell you, I'll do anything.

275
00:25:47,317 --> 00:25:51,435
I'll scare them real bad. The point is, folks,
I'm gonna do anything to get your business.

276
00:25:51,613 --> 00:25:53,820
Hell, I'll possess myself if I gotta.

277
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:57,153
Wow! Yo, I got demons
running all through me.

278
00:25:57,327 --> 00:25:59,534
All through me.
Come on down here and see it

279
00:25:59,704 --> 00:26:03,492
and hey, if you act now, you get a free
demon possession with every exorcism.

280
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,156
You can't beat that, can you?

281
00:26:05,335 --> 00:26:06,666
And bring the little pards down.

282
00:26:06,836 --> 00:26:10,954
Hell, we got plenty of snakes and lizards
for them to play with. No problem at all.

283
00:26:11,132 --> 00:26:15,000
So say it once, say it twice,
third time's the charm. And remember:

284
00:26:15,178 --> 00:26:18,670
I'll eat anything you want me to eat
swallow anything you want me to swallow

285
00:26:18,848 --> 00:26:21,840
so come on down, I'll chew on the dog

286
00:26:49,921 --> 00:26:54,836
We need some help. I read something in
this book this morning about emergencies.

287
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:59,218
All right, here it is.
"In case of emergency, draw a door."

288
00:27:03,309 --> 00:27:06,551
"Draw a door"? I don't know why
we keep looking in that stupid book.

289
00:27:10,024 --> 00:27:12,606
Hey, maybe we should try
that "beetle" guy.

290
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,611
Oh.

291
00:27:28,042 --> 00:27:30,704
You didn't actually think
that was gonna work, did you?

292
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:32,502
Ahal

293
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,580
"knock three times."

294
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:18,290
Blugh.

295
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:39,189
Birdies.

296
00:28:48,122 --> 00:28:49,237
Gget it.

297
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:51,372
Lydia: Dad.

298
00:28:51,542 --> 00:28:54,659
- Can't you see I'm relaxing in here?
- Well, I wanna tell you what I saw.

299
00:28:54,837 --> 00:28:58,421
What is the point of my coming up here
if you people won't let me relax?

300
00:28:58,591 --> 00:29:00,627
Pumpkin, sweetheart...

301
00:29:01,761 --> 00:29:03,592
Go help your mother.

302
00:29:03,763 --> 00:29:06,470
Maybe you can relax in a haunted house,
but I can't

303
00:29:12,063 --> 00:29:13,098
Hmm.

304
00:29:13,273 --> 00:29:17,642
Nice building. Bad roof. Good parking.

305
00:29:47,932 --> 00:29:50,093
- Adam?
- This way, honey.

306
00:30:02,447 --> 00:30:04,403
You don't have an appointment, do you?

307
00:30:04,574 --> 00:30:06,054
Well, we didn't know how to make one.

308
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,906
- Appointment for what?
- What do you want?

309
00:30:08,077 --> 00:30:10,068
- We need some help.
- Ha! Already?

310
00:30:10,246 --> 00:30:12,828
You just bit the big one two months ago
and you want help.

311
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:15,164
What does that have
to do with anything?

312
00:30:15,335 --> 00:30:19,044
You're gonna use up
all your help vouchers: D-90s.

313
00:30:19,213 --> 00:30:22,580
You spend 125 years on earth
actually in that house...

314
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:26,923
During which you get only three
class-one d-90 intercessions with juno.

315
00:30:27,096 --> 00:30:30,054
You probably haven't even read through
the manual completely yet.

316
00:30:30,224 --> 00:30:33,057
You'll have to wait if you don't have
an appointment.

317
00:30:33,227 --> 00:30:37,937
- An appointment with whom?
- For juno, your caseworker.

318
00:30:40,318 --> 00:30:44,277
Number 54,000,601. Ferndock.

319
00:31:49,971 --> 00:31:52,553
- Want a cigarette?
- Uh, no, thank you.

320
00:31:53,766 --> 00:31:56,132
Trying to cut down myself.

321
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:16,862
Adam, is this what happens
when you die?

322
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,700
This 1s what happens when you die.

323
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:22,709
That is what happens when he dies.
And that is what happens when they die.

324
00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:25,712
It's all very personal.
And I'll tell you something.

325
00:32:25,882 --> 00:32:30,046
If I knew then what I know now,
I wouldn't have had my little accident.

326
00:32:35,725 --> 00:32:37,556
Maitland. Party of two.

327
00:32:37,727 --> 00:32:40,343
Take the handbook
and go to the sixth door.

328
00:32:40,813 --> 00:32:43,475
Oh, we forgot our handbook.

329
00:32:47,028 --> 00:32:48,484
Come on.

330
00:32:53,743 --> 00:32:57,361
Woman: All new arrivals,
report to waiting room number 8.

331
00:32:59,916 --> 00:33:03,408
Flight 409 is arriving at gate 3.

332
00:33:03,586 --> 00:33:06,123
How do I look?
There are no mirrors on this side

333
00:33:06,297 --> 00:33:07,878
fine. You look fine. Yeah?

334
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:10,009
- Fine.
- Thanks. I've been feeling a little flat.

335
00:33:15,806 --> 00:33:18,969
Woman: Will the Peterson party
report to door number 9?

336
00:33:20,436 --> 00:33:24,020
Peterson party,
please report to door number 9.

337
00:33:24,857 --> 00:33:28,224
All new arrivals,
report to waiting room number 8.

338
00:33:34,742 --> 00:33:37,779
A hundred and 25 years.
I can't believe this

339
00:33:37,954 --> 00:33:40,195
I can't believe they didn't tell us.

340
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:45,537
Oh, Adam, what is this?

341
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,127
That's the lost souls' room.

342
00:33:52,301 --> 00:33:55,043
A room for ghosts
that have been exorcised.

343
00:33:56,138 --> 00:33:57,753
Poor devils.

344
00:33:57,932 --> 00:34:00,048
That's death for the dead.

345
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:03,351
It's all in the handbook.

346
00:34:03,563 --> 00:34:05,053
Keep moving.

347
00:34:10,152 --> 00:34:11,483
Five

348
00:34:12,488 --> 00:34:14,570
this is the sixth door.

349
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:24,572
Boy, oh, boy, this place just gets weirder
and weirder.

350
00:34:30,923 --> 00:34:32,584
Barbara.

351
00:34:35,511 --> 00:34:37,092
We're home.

352
00:34:38,014 --> 00:34:41,848
Look at this place. Everything's different.

353
00:34:42,893 --> 00:34:45,100
All our furniture's gone.

354
00:34:45,688 --> 00:34:48,304
How long do you suppose
we were waiting there?

355
00:34:48,482 --> 00:34:49,972
Three months.

356
00:34:51,152 --> 00:34:54,019
I'd almost given up on you.
I was about to leave.

357
00:34:54,196 --> 00:34:56,482
I do have other clients.

358
00:34:56,657 --> 00:34:59,239
Are you juno, our caseworker?
Yes.

359
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:02,573
I evaluate individual cases
and determine

360
00:35:02,747 --> 00:35:05,955
if help is needed,
deserved and available

361
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:07,865
- are you available?
- No_

362
00:35:09,337 --> 00:35:12,545
- What's wrong?
- We're very unhappy.

363
00:35:12,715 --> 00:35:14,501
What did you expect? You're dead.

364
00:35:14,675 --> 00:35:16,711
We want to get rid of the people
who moved in here.

365
00:35:16,886 --> 00:35:19,298
Barbara and I worked very hard
on this house.

366
00:35:19,472 --> 00:35:22,555
We probably wouldn't mind sharing
the house with people who were...

367
00:35:22,725 --> 00:35:24,966
More like you used to be. Yes.

368
00:35:25,144 --> 00:35:26,725
But these people...

369
00:35:28,689 --> 00:35:30,850
Things seem pretty quiet here.

370
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:35,067
You should thank god
you didn't die in Italy.

371
00:35:35,529 --> 00:35:36,814
The deetzes.

372
00:35:36,989 --> 00:35:40,902
- Okay, have you been studying the manual?
- Well, we tried.

373
00:35:41,077 --> 00:35:44,911
The intermediate interface chapter
on haunting says it all.

374
00:35:45,081 --> 00:35:48,164
Get them out yourselves. It's your house.

375
00:35:49,335 --> 00:35:51,917
Haunted houses aren't easy to come by.

376
00:35:52,088 --> 00:35:54,420
- Well, we don't quite get it.
- I heard.

377
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,421
Tore your faces right off.

378
00:35:56,592 --> 00:35:59,550
It doesn't do any good to pull your
heads off in front of people...

379
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,926
If they can't see you.

380
00:36:01,097 --> 00:36:03,258
- We should start more simply?
- Start simply.

381
00:36:03,432 --> 00:36:06,219
Do what you know.
Use your talents. Practice.

382
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:11,888
You should have been studying
those lessons since day one.

383
00:36:14,026 --> 00:36:18,110
- Ooh. I've got to go.
- What about that guy in the flyer, betel...?

384
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,315
Shh!

385
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:22,732
Don't even say his name.
You don't want his help.

386
00:36:23,285 --> 00:36:24,775
- Well...
- We might.

387
00:36:24,954 --> 00:36:28,617
No, you don't.
He does not work well with others.

388
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,490
What do you mean?

389
00:36:35,673 --> 00:36:37,459
I didn't want to bring it up.

390
00:36:37,633 --> 00:36:42,218
But rather than have you stumble onto it
and make another mistake, I'll tell you.

391
00:36:42,805 --> 00:36:44,716
He was my assistant.

392
00:36:45,141 --> 00:36:48,224
But he was a troublemaker.
He went out on his own

393
00:36:48,394 --> 00:36:51,477
gs a freelance bio-exorcist.

394
00:36:51,647 --> 00:36:55,640
Claimed he could get rid of the living.
Got into more trouble.

395
00:36:59,697 --> 00:37:03,690
In fact, I believe he's been
sleazing around your cemetery lately.

396
00:37:05,244 --> 00:37:07,986
The only way he can be brought back...

397
00:37:08,164 --> 00:37:11,281
Is by calling his name three times.

398
00:37:12,084 --> 00:37:14,291
But I strongly suggest...

399
00:37:14,462 --> 00:37:17,329
That you remove
the deetzes yourselves.

400
00:37:18,132 --> 00:37:21,044
Well, how do we contact you
if we need you again?

401
00:37:31,312 --> 00:37:34,554
Oh, Adam, that guy's in our cemetery.

402
00:37:34,732 --> 00:37:38,350
She's right, honey. We just have to
keep this simple. We can do this. Come on.

403
00:38:02,301 --> 00:38:05,008
Betelgeuse:
Hey, you. Hey, come here.

404
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:07,010
Hungry?

405
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:09,172
Come on. Hey, come here.

406
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:13,392
I got something good for you.
Come on. Come on over.

407
00:38:13,562 --> 00:38:16,349
We'll have a little bite,
you'll have something to nosh.

408
00:38:17,817 --> 00:38:22,402
- Come here.
Fly: Help me. Help me. Help me.

409
00:38:24,657 --> 00:38:28,741
Maxie, have I not always made you money?
I think that's the only real question here.

410
00:38:28,911 --> 00:38:31,402
Well, Charles,
nobody made me money like you.

411
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,741
I mean, before your nerves went,
you were a demon.

412
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:39,370
It's just that winter river, Connecticut
is, if you'll forgive me, nowhere.

413
00:38:39,547 --> 00:38:42,755
Why would I wanna invest
that kind of money in an old building...

414
00:38:42,925 --> 00:38:46,383
- Way the hell up there?
- It's not a building. That's the beauty of it.

415
00:38:46,554 --> 00:38:50,547
These people don't know the value of
their property. I can buy the whole town.

416
00:38:50,724 --> 00:38:53,306
Oh, then we own a whole town
in the middle of nowhere

417
00:38:53,477 --> 00:38:55,513
Max, you've got to come up here
and see.

418
00:38:55,688 --> 00:38:57,849
Charles: And, uh, bring Sarah.

419
00:38:58,023 --> 00:39:01,607
Yeah, all right, Charles.
It's just that I am kind of busy here.

420
00:39:02,987 --> 00:39:04,352
Uh, just a minute, maxie.

421
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:07,693
Now, listen. Enough of this talk
about visiting, okay? I gotta go.

422
00:39:07,867 --> 00:39:10,404
Maxie:
You take it easy up there, big fellow.

423
00:39:10,578 --> 00:39:13,285
- Goodbye.
- Uh, Max, wait, wait, wait.

424
00:39:17,376 --> 00:39:18,411
Putz.

425
00:39:39,273 --> 00:39:43,482
Jeez, Lydia, is Connecticut so boring?
I had maxie Dean on the phone, honey.

426
00:39:43,652 --> 00:39:47,395
Dad's found a way of making some money
while I relax, so would you scram?

427
00:39:49,825 --> 00:39:53,317
Your mother's gonna kill you when she sees
you cut holes in her $300 sheets.

428
00:39:56,206 --> 00:39:59,824
This is so corny. Is this what
we've been reduced to? Sheets?

429
00:40:00,002 --> 00:40:01,663
Adam:
Think of them as death shrouds.

430
00:40:01,837 --> 00:40:04,328
And the moaning is important.
Really moan.

431
00:40:22,858 --> 00:40:25,315
God, how can he stand that woman?

432
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:35,493
Cut it out. I'm a child, for god's sakes.

433
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:47,208
Barbara: I feel so stupid.
Adam: It's not stupid. We're ghosts.

434
00:40:47,383 --> 00:40:50,420
Do you want to spend the next 125 years
having breakfast with this woman?

435
00:40:50,594 --> 00:40:52,130
Moan louder.

436
00:41:00,562 --> 00:41:02,177
Adam: Oh, god.

437
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:12,025
Sick. Sexual perversion.

438
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:15,908
If you guys are gonna do that weird
sexual stuff, do it in your own bedroom.

439
00:41:22,835 --> 00:41:23,870
No feet.

440
00:41:35,264 --> 00:41:37,471
Are you the guys hiding out in the attic?

441
00:41:37,641 --> 00:41:39,927
Adam: We're ghosts.

442
00:41:40,102 --> 00:41:41,137
Barbara: Whoo!

443
00:41:41,311 --> 00:41:43,927
- What do you look like under there?
Adam: Aren't you scared?

444
00:41:44,106 --> 00:41:47,143
I'm not scared of sheets.
Are you gross under there?

445
00:41:47,317 --> 00:41:49,854
Are you night of the living dead
under there?

446
00:41:50,029 --> 00:41:52,441
Like all bloody veins and pus?

447
00:41:52,614 --> 00:41:55,276
- Night of the what?
- Living dead. It's a movie.

448
00:41:55,451 --> 00:41:58,909
If I had seen a ghost at your age,
I would have been scared out of my wits.

449
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,697
You're not gross.
Why are you wearing sheets?

450
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:04,206
We're practicing.

451
00:42:04,376 --> 00:42:07,960
- You can see us without the sheets?
- Of course I can see you.

452
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:10,542
Well, how is it that you see us
and nobody else can?

453
00:42:12,009 --> 00:42:15,627
Well, I read through that
handbook for the recently deceased.

454
00:42:15,804 --> 00:42:20,468
It says, "live people ignore
the strange and unusual."

455
00:42:21,101 --> 00:42:25,310
I myself am strange and unusual.

456
00:42:25,981 --> 00:42:28,393
You look like a regular girl to me.

457
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:30,808
Adam: You read our book? Yeah

458
00:42:30,986 --> 00:42:33,819
- you could follow it?
- Yeah. Why were you in Delia's bedroom?

459
00:42:33,989 --> 00:42:36,947
- We were trying to scare your mother.
- Stepmother.

460
00:42:37,117 --> 00:42:40,575
Anyway, you can't scare her.
She's sleeping with prince valium tonight.

461
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:47,617
You did this? You carved all these
little houses and things?

462
00:42:47,795 --> 00:42:49,001
Mm-hm.

463
00:42:49,171 --> 00:42:51,036
And this used to be your house.

464
00:42:52,007 --> 00:42:54,293
Why do you want to scare everybody?

465
00:42:54,468 --> 00:42:57,301
Well, we wanted to frighten you
so you would move out.

466
00:42:59,223 --> 00:43:01,054
You don't know the deetzes very well.

467
00:43:01,225 --> 00:43:04,888
My father bought this place.
He never walks away from equity.

468
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:07,226
Why don't you leave? “We can't

469
00:43:07,397 --> 00:43:09,308
we haven't left the house
since the funeral

470
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:12,020
funeral

471
00:43:12,194 --> 00:43:14,856
god. You guys really are dead.

472
00:43:17,282 --> 00:43:18,522
This is amazing.

473
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:20,774
Charles: Lydia.

474
00:43:20,953 --> 00:43:22,614
I better go. “Wait.

475
00:43:22,788 --> 00:43:27,373
- Don't tell your parents that we're up here.
- Unless you think it'll frighten them away.

476
00:43:28,043 --> 00:43:29,783
You tell them that we are horrible.

477
00:43:29,962 --> 00:43:34,376
Desperate, ghoulish creatures who will
stop at nothing to get our house back.

478
00:43:36,677 --> 00:43:40,886
What if this is a dream? Can you guys do
any tricks to prove I'm not dreaming?

479
00:43:44,893 --> 00:43:49,728
Well, if you are real ghosts, you guys better
get another routine because those sheets...

480
00:43:49,898 --> 00:43:51,889
They don't work.

481
00:44:01,368 --> 00:44:02,574
Delia: Ghosts.

482
00:44:02,744 --> 00:44:05,030
You're telling me we have ghosts
in this house

483
00:44:05,205 --> 00:44:07,742
those pictures are of ghosts. Are they?

484
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:09,156
(Hosts.

485
00:44:10,294 --> 00:44:13,286
Lydia, I am giving a dinner party
tonight for seven people.

486
00:44:13,463 --> 00:44:17,001
My agent, Bernard, is bringing a woman
who writes for art in America.

487
00:44:17,176 --> 00:44:21,419
In fact, no one dining here this evening
has not been in vanity fair except you.

488
00:44:21,597 --> 00:44:23,588
I told them you were too mean
to be afraid.

489
00:44:23,765 --> 00:44:25,596
Don't you dare speak to others about me.

490
00:44:25,767 --> 00:44:29,760
Being embarrassed in front of the few
people who will set foot in here scares me.

491
00:44:29,938 --> 00:44:32,395
So let's play family just for tonight, hmm?

492
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,271
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.

493
00:44:40,449 --> 00:44:42,531
She's got photos, Barbara.

494
00:44:42,701 --> 00:44:45,443
Adam, you had a photo of bigfoot.

495
00:44:46,121 --> 00:44:49,113
My photo of bigfoot is a different story.

496
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:50,952
Anyhow, we've gotta get some help here.

497
00:44:51,126 --> 00:44:53,788
We've gotta contact this guy, betelmeyer,
or something.

498
00:45:01,345 --> 00:45:02,926
Adam.

499
00:45:07,267 --> 00:45:08,302
I ook.

500
00:45:13,148 --> 00:45:14,979
It's him. Betelgeuse.

501
00:45:16,777 --> 00:45:18,267
Betelgeuse.

502
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:22,271
Go ahead, Barbara, say it.

503
00:45:23,116 --> 00:45:24,822
Betelgeuse.

504
00:45:28,789 --> 00:45:30,495
What happened?

505
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:33,786
I think we're in the model.

506
00:45:37,172 --> 00:45:38,503
Hey, look at that.

507
00:46:02,197 --> 00:46:03,812
Well, where is he? What do we do?

508
00:46:07,869 --> 00:46:09,154
Looks like we dig, Barbara.

509
00:46:40,235 --> 00:46:42,021
Oh, it's about time.

510
00:46:50,454 --> 00:46:53,321
- I say we open it.
- Maybe we should knock first.

511
00:47:03,759 --> 00:47:05,090
Yeah.

512
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:14,387
Adam. Babs.

513
00:47:21,401 --> 00:47:25,269
Boy, do you know how to pick them. Is this
relationship solid? Do I have a shot at her?

514
00:47:25,447 --> 00:47:27,608
- Excuse me.
- Sure. Am I overstepping my bounds?

515
00:47:27,783 --> 00:47:30,445
Just tell me. Come on.
Know what's beautiful about this?

516
00:47:30,619 --> 00:47:33,235
You two kids picked me.
You didn't have to, but you picked me.

517
00:47:33,413 --> 00:47:36,029
It makes me want to kiss you guys.
Come on, give me one.

518
00:47:36,208 --> 00:47:38,199
- Nol!
- L1 beg your pardon.

519
00:47:38,377 --> 00:47:40,117
All right, let's get down to business.

520
00:47:40,295 --> 00:47:43,253
I've got a card here somewhere.
Here who do I have to kill?

521
00:47:43,423 --> 00:47:45,334
Here, hold that for me, will you?

522
00:47:46,718 --> 00:47:48,925
- There you go.
- You don't have to kill anybody.

523
00:47:49,096 --> 00:47:50,302
Ah, possession. Good.

524
00:47:50,472 --> 00:47:53,635
Betelgeuse: Learn to throw your voice.
Fool your friends. Fun at parties.

525
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:56,846
No. We just wanna
get some people out of our house.

526
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:01,605
I understand. Well, look, in order to do that,
I'm gonna have to get to know you guys.

527
00:48:01,775 --> 00:48:04,266
We've got to get closer.
Move in with you for a while.

528
00:48:04,444 --> 00:48:06,776
Get to be real pals.
You know what I'm saying? In...

529
00:48:08,448 --> 00:48:09,813
Save that guy for later, huh?

530
00:48:09,991 --> 00:48:12,152
My wife and I would like to ask
a couple of questions.

531
00:48:12,327 --> 00:48:16,616
- Sure, sure, sure. Go ahead. Shoot.
- For instance, what are your qualifications?

532
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:18,997
Ah. Well, I attended Juilliard.

533
00:48:19,167 --> 00:48:21,203
I'm a graduate of
the Harvard business school

534
00:48:21,378 --> 00:48:24,370
I lived through the black plague.
And I had a pretty good time during that.

535
00:48:24,548 --> 00:48:27,085
I've seen the exorcist about 167 times

536
00:48:27,259 --> 00:48:30,877
and it keeps getting funnier
every single time I see it.

537
00:48:31,054 --> 00:48:33,761
Not to mention the fact
that you're talking to a dead guy.

538
00:48:33,932 --> 00:48:37,015
Now, what do you think?
You think I'm qualified?

539
00:48:38,145 --> 00:48:40,010
What I mean is, can you be scary?

540
00:48:40,188 --> 00:48:41,188
Oh! Oh.

541
00:48:41,356 --> 00:48:44,189
I know what you're asking me.
Can I be scary?

542
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:46,646
What do you think of this?

543
00:48:48,029 --> 00:48:49,439
You like it?

544
00:48:50,532 --> 00:48:53,990
- Will you excuse us, please?
- Sure. Talk amongst yourself.

545
00:48:54,161 --> 00:48:57,369
- Adam, let's go.
- I know, but I think he can be useful later.

546
00:48:57,539 --> 00:49:00,030
Barbara: We can work something out.
- Oh, yeah.

547
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:01,869
Barbara: Hey, hey, hey.
Adam: Excuse me.

548
00:49:02,043 --> 00:49:05,206
- What?
- Excuse me. We are leaving now.

549
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,371
Oh, come on. Don't go yet.

550
00:49:07,549 --> 00:49:09,881
Hey, guy, come on. We're simpatico here.

551
00:49:10,051 --> 00:49:12,133
Look at us, huh?
We even shop at the same store.

552
00:49:12,304 --> 00:49:13,965
Hey, hermano.

553
00:49:14,139 --> 00:49:15,754
Yeah, there you go.

554
00:49:16,975 --> 00:49:20,263
Hey, come on. We're like peas in a pod,
the three of us. Let's face it

555
00:49:20,437 --> 00:49:24,646
you want somebody out of the house.
I want to get somebody out of your house.

556
00:49:24,816 --> 00:49:28,229
Look. We've been to saturn.
Hey, I've been to saturn.

557
00:49:28,403 --> 00:49:30,815
Whoa. Sandworms.

558
00:49:30,989 --> 00:49:34,152
You hate them, right?
I hate them myself.

559
00:49:34,326 --> 00:49:38,035
Come on, kids, what do I have to do
to strike a deal with you two, huh?

560
00:49:45,295 --> 00:49:47,502
- Don't you hate it when that happens?
- Let's go.

561
00:49:47,672 --> 00:49:51,756
Wait a minute. Just come up for a while.
We'll talk inside. Come on. Come on.

562
00:49:51,927 --> 00:49:54,259
Barbara: I'm not staying here.
- The place is a mess.

563
00:49:54,429 --> 00:49:57,011
- We have to get out of here.
- I'll fix you something to eat.

564
00:49:57,182 --> 00:49:58,547
Home. Home home.

565
00:50:00,352 --> 00:50:03,765
- Barbara, how did you do that?
- Hope you like Italian.

566
00:50:03,939 --> 00:50:07,147
Where'd you go? Hey, come on.
Hey, where'd you go?

567
00:50:07,317 --> 00:50:09,433
Hey. Come on.
You've got to work with me here.

568
00:50:09,611 --> 00:50:12,273
I'm just trying to cut a deal.
What do you want me to do?

569
00:50:12,447 --> 00:50:13,778
Where are you?

570
00:50:13,949 --> 00:50:16,281
You bunch of losers!

571
00:50:16,451 --> 00:50:19,284
You're working with a professional here.

572
00:50:23,667 --> 00:50:24,747
Nice fucking model.

573
00:50:26,127 --> 00:50:28,493
Barbara:
See, we can do this stuff on our own.

574
00:50:28,672 --> 00:50:31,709
Besides, I'm not exposing that little
girl to that pervert down there.

575
00:50:31,883 --> 00:50:34,750
Barbara, we did call him,
and he seemed awfully pissed off.

576
00:50:34,928 --> 00:50:36,464
I don't care. I've changed my mind.

577
00:50:36,638 --> 00:50:40,176
Listen, I think we can scare them off
ourselves, tonight.

578
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:41,840
I have an idea.

579
00:50:49,484 --> 00:50:51,475
I think what you did with the place
is wonderful

580
00:50:51,653 --> 00:50:53,644
not me. Them.

581
00:50:54,656 --> 00:50:56,738
S07? Oh um

582
00:50:58,827 --> 00:51:00,158
uh

583
00:51:00,704 --> 00:51:02,410
You like them

584
00:51:03,498 --> 00:51:06,990
I just hope it wasn't yet another
of your dreary suicide attempts.

585
00:51:07,168 --> 00:51:09,830
You know what they say about people
who commit suicide?

586
00:51:10,005 --> 00:51:12,792
In the afterlife,
they become civil servants.

587
00:51:15,427 --> 00:51:18,169
Otho, I didn't realize
you were into the supernatural.

588
00:51:18,346 --> 00:51:20,337
Well, of course. You remember.

589
00:51:20,515 --> 00:51:23,257
After my stint with the living theatre...

590
00:51:23,602 --> 00:51:26,935
I was one of New York City's
leading paranormal researchers...

591
00:51:27,105 --> 00:51:28,936
Until the bottom dropped out in "72.

592
00:51:29,107 --> 00:51:32,645
Paranormal? Is that what
they're calling your kind these days?

593
00:51:32,902 --> 00:51:37,521
Don't mind her. She's still upset because
somebody dropped a house on her sister.

594
00:51:40,827 --> 00:51:43,364
Well, this looks really good.

595
00:51:44,748 --> 00:51:46,113
I saw some ghosts.

596
00:51:52,756 --> 00:51:56,294
- It's a little private joke Lydia and I share.
- It's not a joke.

597
00:51:56,468 --> 00:52:00,711
Yes, it is. Just today she tried
to convince me that this house is haunted.

598
00:52:02,974 --> 00:52:05,511
Kids. You know, I love them.

599
00:52:06,895 --> 00:52:10,103
- By ghosts?
- In designer sheets, no less.

600
00:52:11,149 --> 00:52:14,016
I'd like to propose a toast
to our intrepid friends...

601
00:52:14,194 --> 00:52:17,402
Who braved the expressway
and two dozen tollbooths to be with us.

602
00:52:17,572 --> 00:52:19,233
May your buildings go condo.

603
00:52:20,867 --> 00:52:23,859
Now, Lydia, favor us about your ghosts.

604
00:52:24,037 --> 00:52:26,403
No. I am sick of that subject.

605
00:52:26,581 --> 00:52:28,742
Oh, Delia, lighten up.

606
00:52:28,917 --> 00:52:31,124
I would rather talk about...

607
00:52:46,226 --> 00:52:47,932
That's cute, Delia.

608
00:53:00,365 --> 00:53:02,447
Otho, are you doing this?

609
00:54:30,121 --> 00:54:31,486
We did it.

610
00:54:33,124 --> 00:54:34,864
I et's watch them scatter.

611
00:54:35,043 --> 00:54:38,535
Any minute now they're gonna come
running out of that door screaming.

612
00:54:41,925 --> 00:54:43,415
Any minute now.

613
00:54:50,517 --> 00:54:52,223
Lydia: It's me, Lydia.

614
00:54:55,605 --> 00:54:57,391
They want you to come downstairs.

615
00:54:57,899 --> 00:55:01,062
Delia says you can wear
any sheets you want.

616
00:55:01,945 --> 00:55:04,402
It was like being in an amusement park.

617
00:55:04,572 --> 00:55:05,732
Wham!

618
00:55:05,907 --> 00:55:09,741
I didn't even know I could do the
calypso. “Who has more fun than us?

619
00:55:09,911 --> 00:55:12,573
We're dealing with
Tracy and hepburn here.

620
00:55:12,747 --> 00:55:16,365
A very sophisticated pair.
I mean, they even appear in sheets.

621
00:55:17,919 --> 00:55:21,753
Charles, what I wanna know is
why didn't you tell us about this before?

622
00:55:21,923 --> 00:55:24,084
Well, we're not even sure
we want our secret out.

623
00:55:24,259 --> 00:55:27,251
I mean, everyone's gonna want them
for their parties, ha, ha.

624
00:55:27,428 --> 00:55:29,108
People will pay big money for this, grace.

625
00:55:29,764 --> 00:55:33,256
The enquirer is offering $50,000
for proof of life after death.

626
00:55:33,434 --> 00:55:34,924
Delia: Fifty thousand?

627
00:55:35,103 --> 00:55:38,095
This is it, Charles.
You can get maxie Dean up here now.

628
00:55:38,523 --> 00:55:41,811
- You think so?
- Sarah loves the supernatural.

629
00:55:41,985 --> 00:55:44,317
She'll have him sprint up here
in his helicopter...

630
00:55:44,487 --> 00:55:46,478
If you can produce ghosts for her.

631
00:55:48,449 --> 00:55:49,609
Oh, Charles.

632
00:55:50,535 --> 00:55:53,197
I should remind you all
that I am Delia's agent.

633
00:55:53,371 --> 00:55:55,953
I have consistently lost money
on her work for years.

634
00:55:56,124 --> 00:55:58,615
If anything actually happened here,
I shall handle it.

635
00:55:58,793 --> 00:56:01,079
But not until I've seen some real proof.

636
00:56:01,254 --> 00:56:05,088
- But, Bernard, what about this table?
- What just happened, what was that?

637
00:56:05,258 --> 00:56:07,123
And what money?
Don't you believe in my work?

638
00:56:07,302 --> 00:56:08,542
Charles: Uh-uh-uh!

639
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,256
Here's Lydia.

640
00:56:11,055 --> 00:56:13,967
- Well?
- They don't want to come down.

641
00:56:15,184 --> 00:56:16,890
Delia: Charles.

642
00:56:21,316 --> 00:56:23,147
Why not?

643
00:56:23,943 --> 00:56:28,562
I think the reason is that they were trying
to scare you away, and you didn't get scared.

644
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,403
Please, they're dead.
It's 3 little late to be neurotic.

645
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:37,195
All right.

646
00:56:43,212 --> 00:56:47,296
This was not a hallucination.
This was real

647
00:56:47,467 --> 00:56:52,587
we all just experienced a very super-powerful
paranormal experience and it was real.

648
00:56:52,764 --> 00:56:56,803
Delia, you are a flake.
You have always been a flake.

649
00:56:56,976 --> 00:57:00,639
If you insist on frightening people,
do it with your sculpture.

650
00:57:02,565 --> 00:57:03,930
Charles: Drive carefully.

651
00:57:04,108 --> 00:57:06,019
- I'm dead.
- Where do they hide out?

652
00:57:06,611 --> 00:57:09,273
- The attic.
- The attic's locked.

653
00:57:09,739 --> 00:57:11,946
They're ghosts, dad.
They can do what they want.

654
00:57:12,116 --> 00:57:15,779
Yeah, they do whatever they want.
Lydia, you take us up there right now.

655
00:57:21,542 --> 00:57:24,875
Fabulous. Otho fenlock's
"I ocked door ghosts"

656
00:57:25,046 --> 00:57:26,627
probably committed suicide up there.

657
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:28,959
- I'm totally enchanted.
Delia: They're in there?

658
00:57:29,133 --> 00:57:32,045
- They must live like animals.
- It's locked. How did they get in?

659
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:35,007
Open this door, you dead people,
or we'll bust it down.

660
00:57:35,181 --> 00:57:37,843
And drag you out by the ropes
you hanged yourself with.

661
00:57:38,017 --> 00:57:40,224
- They didn't commit suicide.
- It doesn't matter.

662
00:57:40,395 --> 00:57:43,808
I have a chance to teach you something.
Take the upper hand in all situations...

663
00:57:43,982 --> 00:57:46,644
Or people, whether dead or alive,
will walk all over you.

664
00:57:46,818 --> 00:57:48,809
Open up!

665
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,121
So where are they?

666
00:58:02,291 --> 00:58:04,828
Listen, you guys, these ghosts
are really nice people.

667
00:58:05,003 --> 00:58:08,336
I think we scared them away,
so let's just leave them alone, all right?

668
00:58:08,631 --> 00:58:12,044
It's the whole damn town.

669
00:58:12,802 --> 00:58:17,421
I have never been so embarrassed.
They haven't gone for good, have they?

670
00:58:18,266 --> 00:58:19,927
Hmm.

671
00:58:23,855 --> 00:58:28,098
Charles: Beep, beep.
- Dad, don't. Mom, let's just go.

672
00:58:39,954 --> 00:58:41,535
No ghosts here.

673
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:47,245
Come on. If they are in here,
I don't want to scare them away.

674
00:58:49,797 --> 00:58:52,834
Well, we're leaving now.
You can go about your business.

675
00:58:55,219 --> 00:58:58,052
Charles: What are we doing?
Delia: Quick, quick, quick.

676
00:59:05,396 --> 00:59:09,230
Oh, boy. You guys are really a couple of
spooksters, aren't you?

677
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:13,063
Now, let's turn on the juice
and see what shakes loose.

678
00:59:15,823 --> 00:59:19,281
Otho, you get maxie on the phone.
We've really got something here.

679
00:59:19,452 --> 00:59:23,570
We can turn this place into the world's
leading supernatural research center.

680
00:59:23,748 --> 00:59:26,911
An amusement park. I'll do a presentation.
Lydia will bring the ghosts.

681
00:59:27,085 --> 00:59:29,872
I can't bring the ghosts, dad.
They're not here.

682
00:59:30,046 --> 00:59:34,460
- Otho, can't you do something?
- Perhaps. If I'm properly motivated.

683
00:59:36,511 --> 00:59:39,253
Just what type of motivation
do you require, otho?

684
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:43,014
Lydia: Why don't you leave them alone?
They didn't do anything to you.

685
00:59:53,528 --> 00:59:55,143
Hi

686
01:00:11,129 --> 01:00:12,790
Whoal

687
01:00:30,982 --> 01:00:33,189
We've come for your daughter, Chuck.

688
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,691
Stop. Stop.

689
01:00:40,908 --> 01:00:42,068
Yeah.

690
01:00:47,415 --> 01:00:50,202
- Betelgeuse, betelgeuse, betelgeuse.
- Oh, no.

691
01:00:52,962 --> 01:00:54,543
Why are you doing this?

692
01:00:55,756 --> 01:00:57,997
Leave me alone, all of you.

693
01:01:01,888 --> 01:01:04,345
Great choice we got here.
We spend the next century...

694
01:01:04,515 --> 01:01:06,972
Either hanging out the window
or doing parlor tricks.

695
01:01:07,143 --> 01:01:09,759
Maybe they'll leave now.
That snake was a nasty customer.

696
01:01:09,937 --> 01:01:11,937
- Well, he could've hurt somebody.
- But he didn't.

697
01:01:12,106 --> 01:01:14,563
We've got them
right where we want them.

698
01:01:18,654 --> 01:01:22,693
You bunch of losers. How dare you interrupt
a professional while he's working.

699
01:01:22,867 --> 01:01:25,449
I'm not fond of Charles deetz,
but you could've killed him.

700
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:28,783
Hey, I'm just doing my job.
Besides, I thought we had a deal.

701
01:01:29,624 --> 01:01:32,081
Hey, it's okay. You know why?

702
01:01:32,251 --> 01:01:35,835
I don't wanna do business
with you deadbeats anyway, thank you.

703
01:01:36,005 --> 01:01:39,793
The only one I think I can deal with
is Edgar Allan poe's daughter.

704
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:42,299
- I think she understands me.
- You leave her alone, you...

705
01:01:43,304 --> 01:01:44,794
Ow!

706
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:56,976
Go ahead, make my millennium.

707
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:04,355
Yeah.

708
01:02:04,533 --> 01:02:08,446
I'm feeling a little, uh, ooh, anxious,
if you know what I mean.

709
01:02:08,621 --> 01:02:10,987
It's been about 600 years, after all.

710
01:02:11,165 --> 01:02:14,828
I wonder where a guy,
an everyday Joe like myself...

711
01:02:15,002 --> 01:02:16,993
Can find a little action.

712
01:02:17,171 --> 01:02:18,502
Woman: Hi

713
01:02:19,382 --> 01:02:20,838
yeah.

714
01:02:24,887 --> 01:02:26,673
Woman: Come on. Come on in.

715
01:02:34,063 --> 01:02:36,179
Oh, yeah. Here I come, baby.

716
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:42,522
Oh, yeah. Hey, Adam, nice move.

717
01:02:43,948 --> 01:02:46,485
- Adam, why did you build that?
- I didn't.

718
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:55,623
Woman: All new arrivals report
to waiting room number 8.

719
01:02:56,627 --> 01:02:59,039
Will you guys shut up
and leave me alone?

720
01:02:59,213 --> 01:03:01,374
I've got all this paperwork to do.

721
01:03:03,843 --> 01:03:05,799
You two, come in here. Sit down.

722
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:07,881
Get in here, both of you.

723
01:03:11,517 --> 01:03:16,056
The whorehouse was my idea.
I want betelgeuse out of the picture.

724
01:03:16,814 --> 01:03:19,351
You two have really screwed up.

725
01:03:19,525 --> 01:03:22,392
I received word you allowed yourselves
to be photographed.

726
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:25,403
And you let betelgeuse out
and didn't put him back.

727
01:03:25,573 --> 01:03:27,859
And you let otho
get hold of the handbook.

728
01:03:28,034 --> 01:03:29,319
The handbook? When?

729
01:03:30,328 --> 01:03:32,819
Never trust the living.

730
01:03:32,997 --> 01:03:35,659
We cannot have
a routine haunting like yours...

731
01:03:35,833 --> 01:03:39,917
Provide proof that there is existence
beyond death.

732
01:03:40,087 --> 01:03:43,454
- Coach. Coach, where's the men's room?
Football player: Yeah

733
01:03:43,632 --> 01:03:46,248
I'm not your coach. He survived.

734
01:03:46,427 --> 01:03:49,043
Football player:
Wait, coach, let me get something straight.

735
01:03:49,221 --> 01:03:52,088
- What's our curfew around here?
- Will you get out of here?

736
01:03:53,017 --> 01:03:55,258
Go on, get downstairs. "Men's room."

737
01:03:55,436 --> 01:03:57,927
Are you kidding? Can't you read signs?

738
01:03:58,356 --> 01:04:00,096
I'll be right back.

739
01:04:00,608 --> 01:04:02,644
Football player:
Come on. Get out of my way.

740
01:04:11,994 --> 01:04:14,235
Maybe this was all a bad idea.

741
01:04:14,413 --> 01:04:16,404
I didn't say anything.

742
01:04:18,376 --> 01:04:21,413
Oh, who are we kidding, Charles”
you've never had a bad idea.

743
01:04:21,587 --> 01:04:22,747
Yeah?

744
01:04:25,007 --> 01:04:27,168
Yeah, this could all work out.

745
01:04:28,803 --> 01:04:30,088
Home.

746
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:32,795
Though...

747
01:04:33,557 --> 01:04:36,219
I'm not sure that this is
the right environment for Lydia.

748
01:04:36,394 --> 01:04:38,931
- Snakes. Ghosts.
- Shrimp.

749
01:04:40,147 --> 01:04:41,728
You family types.

750
01:04:41,899 --> 01:04:45,687
You've got other things to worry about.
Maxie Dean's coming up here tonight.

751
01:04:45,861 --> 01:04:49,649
You've got to figure out a way to sell
these ghosts. I can only do so much.

752
01:04:49,824 --> 01:04:52,941
What are you gonna do, otho?
Viciously rearrange their environment?

753
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:57,453
I know just as much about the supernatural
as I do about interior design.

754
01:05:05,131 --> 01:05:06,667
"Am.

755
01:05:06,841 --> 01:05:08,547
Alone."

756
01:05:18,519 --> 01:05:20,384
"Am.

757
01:05:20,563 --> 01:05:22,303
Utterly...

758
01:05:22,481 --> 01:05:23,687
Alone.

759
01:05:25,151 --> 01:05:27,187
By the time...

760
01:05:28,529 --> 01:05:29,644
You read this...

761
01:05:30,781 --> 01:05:32,521
Will.

762
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:34,531
Be gone...

763
01:05:35,536 --> 01:05:38,323
Having jumped...

764
01:05:39,582 --> 01:05:43,040
Having plummeted...

765
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:45,121
Off

766
01:05:45,296 --> 01:05:49,790
the winter river bridge."

767
01:05:49,967 --> 01:05:52,629
So I don't care what it takes.

768
01:05:52,803 --> 01:05:55,465
You get the deetzes out of there now.

769
01:05:55,639 --> 01:05:58,881
Woman: Flight 409 arriving.
- Whoa, wait a minute.

770
01:05:59,477 --> 01:06:02,157
Woman: Flight 409 is arriving.
- What are you going to do?

771
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:04,516
To scare them.

772
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:07,477
I want to make sure
it's not some silly parlor trick.

773
01:06:08,777 --> 01:06:09,812
I'll go first, honey.

774
01:06:32,593 --> 01:06:35,756
Not bad. Not bad. Now you.

775
01:06:36,931 --> 01:06:38,262
(50 ahead.

776
01:06:51,987 --> 01:06:54,694
Okay, you look great.

777
01:06:54,865 --> 01:07:00,326
Now, go clean house and don't forget
the photographs and the damned handbook.

778
01:07:00,579 --> 01:07:03,241
Woman.
Please report to door number 9.

779
01:07:03,666 --> 01:07:07,250
All new arrivals,
report to waiting room number 8.

780
01:07:08,462 --> 01:07:11,374
Coach? Juno: What?

781
01:07:11,549 --> 01:07:13,915
I don't think we survived that crash.

782
01:07:14,343 --> 01:07:15,879
How did you guess”?

783
01:07:19,223 --> 01:07:21,134
Mr. and Mrs. maitland?

784
01:07:25,896 --> 01:07:27,511
Hello?

785
01:07:28,274 --> 01:07:31,141
- Where are you?
Betelgeuse: Dead.

786
01:07:31,819 --> 01:07:34,026
Dead, dead, deadski.

787
01:07:35,114 --> 01:07:37,070
Of course they're dead. They're ghosts.

788
01:07:37,241 --> 01:07:41,655
No, I mean they're gone. Split.
Out of here. Afterlife kids.

789
01:07:41,829 --> 01:07:45,162
- Deceased.
- Are you a ghost too?

790
01:07:46,083 --> 01:07:48,620
I'm the ghost with the most, babe.

791
01:07:50,963 --> 01:07:54,455
You know, you look like somebody
I can relate to.

792
01:07:55,509 --> 01:07:58,672
Maybe you could help me get out of here,
you know, because...

793
01:07:58,846 --> 01:08:01,508
I gotta tell you,
this, uh, death thing...

794
01:08:04,977 --> 01:08:06,137
It's just too creepy.

795
01:08:06,562 --> 01:08:08,348
See, here's my problem.

796
01:08:08,522 --> 01:08:11,434
I got these friends on the outside
that I said I'd meet.

797
01:08:11,609 --> 01:08:13,895
You know, I have to be there
in person, you know.

798
01:08:14,069 --> 01:08:17,357
So I was just wondering,
could you help me get out of here?

799
01:08:17,781 --> 01:08:18,816
I wanna get in.

800
01:08:20,659 --> 01:08:21,694
Why?

801
01:08:22,244 --> 01:08:23,279
Well, you know...

802
01:08:23,454 --> 01:08:26,992
Hey, you've probably got your reasons,
but I can't do anything from over here.

803
01:08:27,166 --> 01:08:31,876
If you could get me out, over there,
then maybe we could talk or something.

804
01:08:32,046 --> 01:08:35,709
But, you know, in order to do that
you've gotta say my name three times.

805
01:08:35,883 --> 01:08:37,748
What's your name?

806
01:08:37,926 --> 01:08:41,214
- Well, uh, I can't tell you.
- Why not?

807
01:08:41,388 --> 01:08:45,848
Because if I tell you, you'll tell your friends,
they're calling me on the horn all the time.

808
01:08:46,018 --> 01:08:49,727
I've gotta show up at shopping centers for
openings, sign autographs, shit like that.

809
01:08:49,897 --> 01:08:53,389
And it makes my life a hell, okay?
A living hell.

810
01:08:53,567 --> 01:08:58,231
But maybe if you have a pen, maybe
we can... I know. You ever play charades?

811
01:08:58,405 --> 01:09:00,191
- Yeah.
- Good. Good.

812
01:09:00,366 --> 01:09:01,981
Ahh, here we go then. Ready?

813
01:09:02,326 --> 01:09:05,818
- Um, two words.
- Right.

814
01:09:07,414 --> 01:09:09,780
First word, two syllables.

815
01:09:10,042 --> 01:09:11,828
I ook.

816
01:09:12,002 --> 01:09:14,243
You know, just turn around.

817
01:09:15,214 --> 01:09:16,920
I don't know what your signal means.

818
01:09:17,091 --> 01:09:18,877
Turn around and look behind you.

819
01:09:20,135 --> 01:09:21,750
Hi. How are you?

820
01:09:22,596 --> 01:09:25,338
- Beetle.
- Got it. Okay, now, two.

821
01:09:28,602 --> 01:09:30,934
Breakfast”? Orange”? Orange beetle?

822
01:09:31,105 --> 01:09:32,936
Beetle fruit?

823
01:09:33,607 --> 01:09:34,938
Beetle breakfast?

824
01:09:35,734 --> 01:09:37,099
Beetle drink?

825
01:09:37,945 --> 01:09:39,185
Beetle...

826
01:09:39,947 --> 01:09:41,562
Beetle juice?

827
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:44,231
- Yes. That's it.
- Your name's betelgeuse?

828
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:47,243
You said it twice.
Just say it once more. Come on.

829
01:09:47,413 --> 01:09:49,119
It was you, wasn't it?

830
01:09:49,289 --> 01:09:51,075
- Wha... 7? Me”?
- The snake.

831
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:54,083
No, what snake?
You kids and your imagination.

832
01:09:54,253 --> 01:09:55,709
Just say it.

833
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:57,415
No

834
01:09:58,465 --> 01:09:59,796
I want to talk to Barbara.

835
01:09:59,967 --> 01:10:03,459
No, you don't need to talk to Barbara.
Just say it.

836
01:10:06,974 --> 01:10:10,592
Oh, Adam, I can't go through with it.
I like that little girl.

837
01:10:10,769 --> 01:10:14,307
But, Barbara, honey, it's too late.
We have to go through with this.

838
01:10:14,481 --> 01:10:18,474
No, we don't.
I mean, can't we rebel or something?

839
01:10:21,155 --> 01:10:22,941
Barbara.

840
01:10:23,824 --> 01:10:26,110
Adam, I want to be with Lydia.

841
01:10:37,004 --> 01:10:39,586
Come on. Just say it.

842
01:10:40,507 --> 01:10:42,839
Adam: No!
Barbara: No! Lydia, don't say it.

843
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:45,843
You. Say it.

844
01:10:46,013 --> 01:10:48,880
It's okay. It's okay. It's us.
What's going on?

845
01:10:50,017 --> 01:10:51,507
- Betel...
- Shh!

846
01:10:51,685 --> 01:10:55,428
He told me that if I let him out he would
take me to the other side to find you.

847
01:10:55,981 --> 01:10:58,814
No, Lydia, we're dead.

848
01:10:59,902 --> 01:11:02,894
- I wanna be dead too.
- No_

849
01:11:04,323 --> 01:11:05,938
Lydia...

850
01:11:10,537 --> 01:11:13,529
Being dead really doesn't
make things any easier.

851
01:11:13,999 --> 01:11:18,538
Listen to her on this, Lydia.
This is something we know a lot about.

852
01:11:18,712 --> 01:11:22,204
And you can come up here
and visit us anytime you want.

853
01:11:22,925 --> 01:11:26,258
I have a feeling things are going to be
7 little better around here from now on.

854
01:11:28,305 --> 01:11:29,966
What do you mean, better?

855
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:34,930
Well, we've decided that we're going to
invite you and your family to stay.

856
01:11:35,729 --> 01:11:36,729
That's right, Lydia.

857
01:11:42,152 --> 01:11:45,565
Otho: Why can't we bring maxie up here?
- You've got a stake in this too.

858
01:11:45,739 --> 01:11:50,233
This is a presentation. It requires
a sense of occasion, a sense of style.

859
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:52,901
- It's so big. How will we get it out?
- It's sectional

860
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,695
- wait, there are plugs.
- Careful.

861
01:11:54,873 --> 01:11:56,329
Okay, go.

862
01:11:58,252 --> 01:12:01,244
- What's going on?
- I don't know. I'll go find out.

863
01:12:01,421 --> 01:12:03,252
Be careful

864
01:12:04,383 --> 01:12:06,590
we've got ed cornwall
to head the wax museum.

865
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:10,878
Dedicated to 50 great moments of the
paranormal here in Thanksgiving park.

866
01:12:11,056 --> 01:12:13,718
Now, you must remember ed, maxie.

867
01:12:14,142 --> 01:12:18,476
He's the genius who gave us the talking
Marcel marceau statue it was a sensation.

868
01:12:19,189 --> 01:12:23,808
And d-con is on its knees
to sponsor the insect zoo...

869
01:12:23,986 --> 01:12:26,602
Here in the old hardware store.

870
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:28,111
We can't lose.

871
01:12:34,329 --> 01:12:36,365
Lydia, you finally decided to join us.

872
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:38,701
Honey, I just, uh, finished
the initial presentation.

873
01:12:38,876 --> 01:12:41,709
And now I think it's time
to have a stretch

874
01:12:41,879 --> 01:12:45,463
and to invite our friends
to meet your friends, okay?

875
01:12:46,466 --> 01:12:47,956
Are they here yet?

876
01:12:48,635 --> 01:12:51,877
Charles, we're here to see some ghosts.

877
01:12:52,848 --> 01:12:55,214
They're not here anymore.

878
01:12:59,438 --> 01:13:01,804
Every time she says that,
the paint peels...

879
01:13:01,982 --> 01:13:04,974
And, uh, some wild creature
tries to kill us.

880
01:13:06,528 --> 01:13:08,769
But we have these pictures, Lydia.

881
01:13:08,947 --> 01:13:11,984
No, really. They said they might come back
and we could all live here

882
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:16,744
if you agreed not to tease them
or make them do stupid tricks.

883
01:13:17,623 --> 01:13:19,989
She has such a tendency to overreact.

884
01:13:20,167 --> 01:13:24,831
Don't worry, we're not relying on her.
We have otho.

885
01:13:27,174 --> 01:13:30,337
- Are they still here, otho?
- Otho, are they still here?

886
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:34,173
Oh, they're still here.
They're just hiding out.

887
01:13:35,015 --> 01:13:36,926
Probably feel guilty
about what they did to me.

888
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:38,715
They're sorry they didn't kill you.

889
01:13:38,894 --> 01:13:42,261
Well, I don't know from quilt.
I just wanna see them.

890
01:13:43,148 --> 01:13:44,888
Otho, can you do it?

891
01:13:45,067 --> 01:13:48,980
- It'll be tricky, but I think I can handle it.
- No_

892
01:13:53,116 --> 01:13:56,608
Wait. What am I worried about?
Otho, you can't even change a tire.

893
01:13:59,498 --> 01:14:02,331
I'll be needing
something personal of theirs.

894
01:14:02,501 --> 01:14:04,492
You'll have to go to the goodwill.

895
01:14:07,714 --> 01:14:08,874
Fxcuse me.

896
01:14:21,269 --> 01:14:23,100
The wedding clothes.

897
01:14:24,773 --> 01:14:26,138
The words:

898
01:14:34,449 --> 01:14:36,110
Hands vermilion

899
01:14:36,576 --> 01:14:38,862
start of five

900
01:14:39,037 --> 01:14:40,573
bright cotillion

901
01:14:41,665 --> 01:14:43,951
raven's dive

902
01:14:44,126 --> 01:14:45,741
nightshade's promise

903
01:14:46,503 --> 01:14:49,210
spirits strive

904
01:14:49,381 --> 01:14:54,626
to the living
I et now the dead come alive

905
01:15:07,524 --> 01:15:08,934
Barbara?

906
01:15:09,776 --> 01:15:10,891
Barbara?

907
01:15:11,069 --> 01:15:14,277
As sudden thunder pierces night

908
01:15:14,448 --> 01:15:17,235
as magic wonder mad affright

909
01:15:17,576 --> 01:15:20,613
rives asunder man's delight

910
01:15:20,787 --> 01:15:23,824
our ghost, our corpse

911
01:15:23,999 --> 01:15:25,785
and we rise fo be

912
01:15:29,046 --> 01:15:30,252
oh, no.

913
01:15:35,969 --> 01:15:37,129
Help.

914
01:15:37,304 --> 01:15:38,840
Barbara?

915
01:15:45,645 --> 01:15:47,385
Stop it. Shh!

916
01:15:48,315 --> 01:15:49,350
Lydia: No.

917
01:15:49,524 --> 01:15:51,264
Otho: As flies the lizard

918
01:15:51,443 --> 01:15:52,979
serpent fell

919
01:15:53,153 --> 01:15:56,645
as goblin vizard at the spell

920
01:15:56,823 --> 01:16:00,862
the buried, dead and slain rise again

921
01:16:32,734 --> 01:16:34,725
Barbara?

922
01:16:47,332 --> 01:16:48,538
What's happening to them?

923
01:16:50,001 --> 01:16:51,616
I don't know.

924
01:16:53,046 --> 01:16:54,081
They're dying.

925
01:16:54,256 --> 01:16:57,168
No, they're not. They're already dead.
They can't feel a thing.

926
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:01,297
- That's not true. Look at them.
Charles: All right, that's enough now.

927
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:03,466
Can you stop this?

928
01:17:04,558 --> 01:17:05,638
Otho.

929
01:17:05,809 --> 01:17:08,141
It's too late, Charles. I'm sorry.

930
01:17:15,485 --> 01:17:19,353
Where are you? Help them, please.

931
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:25,572
Sure, I can help them.
But you've gotta help me.

932
01:17:25,745 --> 01:17:28,703
- What?
- Look, I'm what you call an illegal alien.

933
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:33,249
I want out for good. In order for me
to do that, hey, I gotta get married.

934
01:17:34,212 --> 01:17:37,955
Hey, these aren't my rules. Come to
think of it, I don't have any rules.

935
01:17:39,885 --> 01:17:41,250
Come on. Come on.

936
01:17:41,428 --> 01:17:45,091
Think of it as a marriage of inconvenience.
Okay? We both get something. I get out.

937
01:17:45,265 --> 01:17:48,678
You get to say you're hitched with
the most eligible bachelor since Valentino.

938
01:17:48,852 --> 01:17:52,185
- We're even, babe.
- Okay, just help them.

939
01:17:54,441 --> 01:17:55,977
Sure.

940
01:18:06,286 --> 01:18:07,286
Betelgeuse.

941
01:18:09,247 --> 01:18:10,407
Betelgeuse.

942
01:18:14,044 --> 01:18:15,079
Betelgeuse.

943
01:18:15,962 --> 01:18:17,543
It's showtime.

944
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,271
Attention, kmart shoppers.

945
01:18:48,245 --> 01:18:53,114
Well, I'm back. I feel real good about
myself. You know what I mean? So...

946
01:18:53,291 --> 01:18:54,952
Without further delay...

947
01:18:56,336 --> 01:19:00,670
Welcome to winter river
museum of natural greed.

948
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:02,751
A monument to the bored businessman.

949
01:19:02,926 --> 01:19:07,090
Come on, a little closer.
Step right up. Test your strength.

950
01:19:28,827 --> 01:19:30,363
Betelgeuse: Thank you.

951
01:19:30,537 --> 01:19:32,027
Thank you.

952
01:19:33,623 --> 01:19:37,366
That is why I won't do
two shows a night anymore, babe.

953
01:19:37,544 --> 01:19:39,034
I won't I won't do them.

954
01:19:39,212 --> 01:19:43,330
Well, what have we
got here tonight, kids?

955
01:19:44,968 --> 01:19:47,254
Well, we've got the, uh, maitlands.

956
01:19:47,429 --> 01:19:50,216
I think they've had enough exercise
for tonight.

957
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:00,438
Not so fast, round boy.
We're gonna have some laughs.

958
01:20:04,237 --> 01:20:05,727
Otho.

959
01:20:16,583 --> 01:20:18,539
Come on, come on, come on.

960
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,291
Yeah.

961
01:20:21,254 --> 01:20:22,994
Mom, dad:

962
01:20:25,383 --> 01:20:28,216
I just want you two to know
you're welcome in our house...

963
01:20:28,386 --> 01:20:30,593
Anytime you want to come over.

964
01:20:30,764 --> 01:20:34,427
In the meantime,
the dowry's on me, dad.

965
01:20:36,936 --> 01:20:39,723
Well, the maitlands are taken care of.

966
01:20:39,898 --> 01:20:43,061
Everything seems to be
pretty much back to normal, I think.

967
01:20:47,781 --> 01:20:49,066
Shall we?

968
01:20:59,167 --> 01:21:01,749
Called the caterer. He's got a great band.

969
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:05,162
We're gonna need witnesses. Would you?

970
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:57,176
Come on. Let's go.
Let's get on with the ceremony.

971
01:21:57,350 --> 01:21:58,931
Do you, betel...

972
01:21:59,102 --> 01:22:00,342
Aah! Uh-uh!

973
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:04,604
- Nobody says the "b" word. Come on.
Preacher: Do you take this woman...

974
01:22:04,774 --> 01:22:07,231
To be your wedded wife?

975
01:22:07,402 --> 01:22:10,018
Oh, jeez, I don't know.
I mean, it's kind of a big decision.

976
01:22:10,196 --> 01:22:14,064
I always said if I ever did it,
I was gonna do it once and that was it.

977
01:22:15,285 --> 01:22:16,616
Sure. Yeah go ahead.

978
01:22:16,786 --> 01:22:19,823
And you, do you, Lydia, take this man...

979
01:22:19,998 --> 01:22:21,204
No betel...

980
01:22:22,959 --> 01:22:26,451
She's a little bit nervous.
Uh, maybe I should answer for her, okay?

981
01:22:26,629 --> 01:22:28,790
I'm Lydia and I'm of sound mind.

982
01:22:28,965 --> 01:22:32,173
The man next to me is the one I want.
You asked me. I'm answering.

983
01:22:32,343 --> 01:22:34,675
Yes, I love that man of mine.

984
01:22:34,846 --> 01:22:36,926
- Come on.
Preacher: Then by the...

985
01:22:37,056 --> 01:22:38,887
Betel...

986
01:22:40,477 --> 01:22:42,638
Come on. Come on.

987
01:22:42,854 --> 01:22:44,264
Betelgeu...

988
01:22:45,315 --> 01:22:47,897
Hey. Hey. Hey.

989
01:22:49,903 --> 01:22:51,143
Scram.

990
01:22:52,947 --> 01:22:54,187
Come on.

991
01:22:56,075 --> 01:22:57,906
Take a hike.

992
01:23:00,705 --> 01:23:03,412
Preacher:
May we continue with the ceremony?

993
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:07,246
- Then by...
- Betelgeuse.

994
01:23:11,925 --> 01:23:14,962
- Betelgeuse.
- Oh, gee.

995
01:23:17,347 --> 01:23:18,587
Strike.

996
01:23:21,768 --> 01:23:23,258
Come on, let's get rolling now, rev.

997
01:23:23,436 --> 01:23:26,428
Then by the authority vested in me...

998
01:23:26,606 --> 01:23:29,268
- The ring, please.
- The ring. Oh, no.

999
01:23:32,529 --> 01:23:34,611
Jewelry store. Here.

1000
01:23:34,781 --> 01:23:35,941
That's not it.

1001
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:39,315
You know I got it, honey.

1002
01:23:55,093 --> 01:23:57,709
Here it is. Here you go.

1003
01:23:57,887 --> 01:24:01,721
I'm telling you, honey, she meant
nothing to me. Nothing at all.

1004
01:24:07,397 --> 01:24:09,604
- I now pronounce you...
- Yeah, yeah, come on.

1005
01:24:11,359 --> 01:24:12,815
Man and...

1006
01:24:12,986 --> 01:24:14,647
Ow!

1007
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,691
Girl: Bye. Lydia: Bye.

1008
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:05,701
Bye.

1009
01:25:05,872 --> 01:25:07,988
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye.

1010
01:25:12,337 --> 01:25:15,875
- What time is it, honey?
- It's about 3:30, I guess.

1011
01:25:16,049 --> 01:25:17,835
Give or take a year.

1012
01:25:20,261 --> 01:25:21,376
Hello?

1013
01:25:24,807 --> 01:25:26,172
Well?

1014
01:25:26,851 --> 01:25:27,886
Did you get the paints?

1015
01:25:28,061 --> 01:25:31,724
Yes. And I took pictures
of the new town hall for you too.

1016
01:25:31,898 --> 01:25:33,578
Barbara:
How'd you do on that science test?

1017
01:25:33,733 --> 01:25:36,645
It was gross.
They wanted me to dissect a frog.

1018
01:25:36,819 --> 01:25:40,357
I told them no way. I said it was
against my religion. So I got a c.

1019
01:25:41,115 --> 01:25:42,355
And how about the math test?

1020
01:25:43,993 --> 01:25:48,236
You have got to be kidding me. We spent
the whole week studying for that test.

1021
01:25:48,414 --> 01:25:50,075
I got an a.

1022
01:25:50,249 --> 01:25:52,205
So can I?

1023
01:25:52,752 --> 01:25:55,915
Well, I don't know.
Got a c on the science test.

1024
01:25:56,923 --> 01:25:59,505
Adam, don't tease her.
You never got on a in science...

1025
01:26:04,722 --> 01:26:05,928
Come on.

1026
01:26:07,517 --> 01:26:09,223
Well

1027
01:26:10,103 --> 01:26:11,388
I suppose.

1028
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:29,819
This thing reads like stereo instructions.

1029
01:26:29,997 --> 01:26:33,114
Sounds like Lydia got an a
on the math test jeez!

1030
01:26:35,128 --> 01:26:36,959
He likes it.

1031
01:27:14,876 --> 01:27:16,207
Hey!

1032
01:27:17,211 --> 01:27:19,543
Sorry. Didn't see you sitting there.

1033
01:27:22,133 --> 01:27:23,669
Women.

1034
01:27:23,843 --> 01:27:26,209
I don't know what her problem is.

1035
01:27:27,013 --> 01:27:28,423
Normally, chicks...

1036
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:45,152
Pardon me. Did you do that?

1037
01:27:45,698 --> 01:27:48,861
That's very nice work. Let me ask,
how do you get them so sm...?

1038
01:27:49,035 --> 01:27:50,946
Hey, there goes Elvis. Yo, king.

1039
01:27:53,414 --> 01:27:56,998
Well, looks like I'm next.

1040
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:03,375
Good thing too. I gotta do a photo shoot
for gq in about an hour and a half.

1041
01:28:03,549 --> 01:28:07,383
They've been after me for months. Doing some
kind of underwear deal, I don't know...

1042
01:28:08,971 --> 01:28:11,883
Hey, what are you doing? Stop it.
You're messing up my hair.

1043
01:28:12,058 --> 01:28:14,891
Come on! Whoa! Whoa! Stop it!

1044
01:28:15,061 --> 01:28:17,643
Whoal

1045
01:28:17,814 --> 01:28:20,556
hey, this might be a good look for me.
