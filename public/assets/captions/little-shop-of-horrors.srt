And at his press conference today,
President Kennedy fielded questions...

49
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:23,888
...concerning last Thursday's
total eclipse of the sun...

00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:28,601
...an unprecedented astrological
phenomenon which has baffled the nation.

...forgive me for saying so, sir,
but has it ever occurred to you...

00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:22,348
...that maybe what the firm needs
is to move in a new direction?

158

...some of those exotic plants
Seymour's been tinkering around with...

163
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:41,117
...are really unusual.

164
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:45,538
And we thought maybe some of
those strange and interesting new plants...

165
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:50,668

would attract business.

What kind of a weirdo plant
is that, Seymour?

I think it's some kind of flytrap...

in any of my books.
