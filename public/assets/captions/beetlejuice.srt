-He drowned?
-Almost.

160
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:18,626
But not quite, no.
According to survivors,

161
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:19,794

00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:28,969
So, how did he die?

00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,008
Just like that.

170
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,678
I just spoke to him
on Saturday.

171
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:38,946
He was so excited,

172
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:41,082
he thanked me
for the binoculars,

173
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:43,350
he said he had observed
the mating rituals

174
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:45,119
of the Tuamotu sandpiper.

175
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:47,121
Yes, he flew halfway
around the world

to watch birds
do it on a beach.

177
00:09:48,823 --> 00:09:49,824
And it killed him!

We need to tell Astrid.

Oh. Must we?

181
00:09:56,197 --> 00:09:57,965
She's already
such a morbid little thing.

00:30:26,927 --> 00:30:28,228
Oh, it's Jane Butterfield-Lee
now.

536
00:30:28,262 --> 00:30:29,496
We hyphenated.

537
00:30:29,531 --> 00:30:30,532
Is that Maxie Dean?

538
00:30:31,965 --> 00:30:33,133
No.

539
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:34,401
No one's here yet.

540
00:30:36,904 --> 00:30:38,506
Sample from
my hubby's microbrewery.

541
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:42,109
"Micro"? Is that for people
with tiny houses?

542
00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:45,379
Why is your house
covered in black fabric?

543
00:30:45,412 --> 00:30:47,448
It's a mourning shroud.

544
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:50,417
Now that Charles is dead,
so also dies this house.

545
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:53,253
And I'm protecting it
in its transition.

546
00:30:53,287 --> 00:30:56,156
To a new life
with a new family.

547
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,559
I can't wait to show it.

548
00:30:57,592 --> 00:30:59,259
Buyers are already lining up.

549
00:30:59,293 --> 00:31:00,994
Thanks to you, Lydia,

550
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:03,197
everyone wants a piece
of the original Ghost House.

551
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,666
Ghosts aren't real.

552
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:07,167
Only gullible people
believe that kind of crap.

553
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:08,636
Unless you're trying to pay
the bills, right, Mom?

554
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,505
[Jane] Okay, honey, in we go.

555
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:13,941
Can I have
everyone's attention, please?

556
00:31:13,974 --> 00:31:14,975
What?

557
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:16,377
We're gathered here today

558
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:20,047
to celebrate the life
of an extraordinary man.

559
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,215
Now, I only had the pleasure

560
00:31:21,248 --> 00:31:22,916
of meeting Charles a few times.

561
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,185
Then I can tell you
he didn't want any speeches.

562
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:27,955
Charles hated
public displays of emotion.

563
00:31:27,988 --> 00:31:31,191
Yeah, but he also...

564
00:31:31,225 --> 00:31:33,260
chose to live his life
to the fullest.

565
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:36,463
I'm going to tear a page
out of Charles Deetz's book.

566
00:31:36,497 --> 00:31:38,298
Lydia,

567
00:31:38,332 --> 00:31:39,466
now, I know
we had always agreed

568
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,501
to take
our relationship slowly.

569
00:31:40,535 --> 00:31:42,136
But I can't wait any longer.

570
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:45,139
Let's get married
on your favorite holiday.

571
00:31:45,172 --> 00:31:47,141
Will you marry me on Halloween?

572
00:31:47,174 --> 00:31:48,375
-[mourner] Good Lord!
-[Lydia] Uh...

573
00:31:49,544 --> 00:31:51,145
That's... That's in two days!

574
00:31:51,178 --> 00:31:52,413
Yes, I know.

575
00:31:52,446 --> 00:31:53,380
I've already spoken
to Father Damien.

576
00:31:53,414 --> 00:31:54,982
The church is available.

577
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:56,316
The Lord's sanctuary
welcomes all who seek

578
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,118
salvation
and everlasting glory.

579
00:31:58,152 --> 00:32:01,155
Just not before noon,
and between three and four.

580
00:32:01,188 --> 00:32:03,490
You're seriously doing this
at Charles' wake?

581
00:32:04,491 --> 00:32:07,394
Yes. Yes. Yes, because...

582
00:32:08,696 --> 00:32:10,698
because as we stand here,

583
00:32:10,732 --> 00:32:12,700
-surrounded by death...
-[scoffs]

584
00:32:12,734 --> 00:32:15,302
...let us all make
a commitment to choose life.

585
00:32:15,335 --> 00:32:16,538
Because I want to spend

586
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:17,639
the rest of my life
with you, Lydia.

587
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,508
And you, Delia.

588
00:32:22,242 --> 00:32:24,044
And you too.

589
00:32:24,077 --> 00:32:25,547
And you. Again.

590
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,381
What do you say?

591
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:30,317
Rory, I... Come on,

592
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,453
I can't commit to this
right now.

593
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:36,558
Oh. [chuckles softly]

594
00:32:37,357 --> 00:32:38,560
All right.

595

This is too much loss.
[sniffles]

What do you mean?

597
00:32:44,632 --> 00:32:46,200
Well, first,
the death of Charles.

598
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:47,669
And of course,
the death of my grandfather,

599
00:32:47,702 --> 00:32:49,303
which you know about.
And now the death of...

00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:53,440
-us.
-No! No, I...

601
00:32:53,474 --> 00:32:55,242
Come on, I didn't mean that.

She won't stop killing,

714
00:38:04,986 --> 00:38:07,889
until she walks him
back down the aisle.

715
00:38:10,057 --> 00:38:14,327
Cases like this make me wonder
why I even became a cop.

716
00:38:14,361 --> 00:38:16,864
[footsteps approaching]

717
00:38:16,898 --> 00:38:18,633
You're not a cop.
You're an actor.

718
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:20,568
Thank you, Janet.

719
00:38:21,602 --> 00:38:22,937
You keep me real.

720
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,437
[Lieutenant] Should we take
this Beetlejuice

721
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:25,706
into protective custody?

722
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,974
See if you can find him.

723
00:38:27,008 --> 00:38:28,576
He's probably laying low.

724
00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:30,678
Scared out of his mind.

725
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:38,653
[Beetlejuice]
A little higher, boys.

726
00:38:38,686 --> 00:38:40,588
We can't let Delores
get through that door.

727
00:38:43,791 --> 00:38:45,059
[Bob grunts]

728
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,360
[snickers]

729
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:49,396
Bob.

730
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:50,463
Like lookin' in a mirror.

731
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:54,035
You see, Bob,
you'd serve as my decoy.

732
00:38:54,068 --> 00:38:55,770
You'd walk in front of me
at all times.

733
00:38:55,803 --> 00:38:59,040
That way she'd suck your soul
while I make my getaway.

734
00:38:59,073 --> 00:39:00,440
[Bob groans]

735
00:39:00,473 --> 00:39:01,943
¿Comprende?

736
00:39:01,976 --> 00:39:03,343
[groans fearfully]

737
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:15,790
Now's my chance.

738
00:39:15,823 --> 00:39:18,425
[suspenseful music builds]

739
00:39:20,761 --> 00:39:21,996
[panting]

740
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:24,065
[distant screaming]

741
00:39:27,902 --> 00:39:29,503
[shouts] What?

742
00:39:29,537 --> 00:39:31,038
-Why?
-[camera shutter clicks]

743
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,641
No! No! No!

744
00:39:33,674 --> 00:39:35,142
Delia, what's wrong?

745
00:39:35,176 --> 00:39:36,777
I'm trying to capture
the perfect primal scream.

746
00:39:36,811 --> 00:39:38,579
I'm gonna blow it up,
mount it on the wall,

747
00:39:38,613 --> 00:39:40,815
and I invite all of you
to do the same.

748
00:39:40,848 --> 00:39:42,683
-Why?
-For the Collective.

749
00:39:42,717 --> 00:39:44,719
We cannot sincerely celebrate

750
00:39:44,752 --> 00:39:47,420
all that was good
about our dearly departed.

751
00:39:47,454 --> 00:39:49,422
Not until we release the horror

752
00:39:49,456 --> 00:39:50,791
that they inflicted upon us.

753
00:39:50,825 --> 00:39:53,426
What awful thing
did Grandpa ever do to you?

754
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,997
He bought this house
without telling me.

755
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,633
[rushing footsteps approaching]

756
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:01,035
Oh, my God!

757
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:02,870
I was helpfully getting
some boxes in town,

758
00:40:02,904 --> 00:40:04,572
then I heard you screaming.
Are you all right?

759
00:40:04,605 --> 00:40:06,473
[stutters] It was Delia.

760
00:40:06,507 --> 00:40:07,875
Oh, Delia.

761
00:40:07,909 --> 00:40:09,110
[exclaims] I'm good.

762
00:40:09,977 --> 00:40:11,212
Ignore her.

763
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:12,980
That was very
thoughtful of you.

764
00:40:13,014 --> 00:40:15,149
Astrid, can you give him
a hand with the boxes?

765
00:40:15,182 --> 00:40:16,918
[scoffs]

766
00:40:16,951 --> 00:40:18,485
I told the movers to come
a week from today. All right?

767
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:19,787
I think that'll give us all
time to get over

768
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,589
our grief and our trauma.

769
00:40:21,622 --> 00:40:22,823
And then, after the wedding,
I think we should go back,

770
00:40:22,857 --> 00:40:24,558
and we gotta
finish those shows.

771
00:40:24,592 --> 00:40:25,826
Maybe Mom can get
the ghosts in the attic

772
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,528
to give us a hand.

773
00:40:27,561 --> 00:40:30,698
Adam and Barbara Maitland.
They're not here anymore.

774
00:40:30,731 --> 00:40:32,465
Why? They find
a better house to haunt?

775
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:35,102
No, we found a loophole,
and they moved on.

776
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,605
How convenient.

777
00:40:37,638 --> 00:40:43,010
-[somber music playing]
-[birds squawking]

778
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:19,180
[mysterious music playing]

779
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:48,609
Ew.

780
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:14,035
[sentimental music playing]

781
00:42:25,813 --> 00:42:29,116
[footsteps approaching]

782
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,025
Oh.

783
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:39,860
God, I thought I lost those.

784
00:42:41,862 --> 00:42:45,900
That was taken at an all-night
Mario Bava horror fest.

785
00:42:45,933 --> 00:42:48,602
I was nine months
pregnant with you.

786
00:42:48,636 --> 00:42:50,971
My water broke during
Kill, Baby... Kill!

787
00:42:52,706 --> 00:42:53,908
Dad's favorite movie.

788
00:42:53,941 --> 00:42:54,975
Yeah.

789
00:42:55,009 --> 00:42:56,010
Can I keep this?

790
00:42:57,044 --> 00:42:58,813
Yeah.

791
00:42:58,846 --> 00:43:00,714
I really like that model
of Winter River, too.

792
00:43:01,649 --> 00:43:03,084
Did Grandpa make that?

793
00:43:03,117 --> 00:43:05,986
[Lydia] No, that belonged
to the Maitlands.

794
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,622
You know,
the non-existent ghost couple.

795
00:43:14,295 --> 00:43:15,596
[ominous music playing]

796
00:43:17,398 --> 00:43:19,066
Oh, I found that on the floor.

797
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:22,269
-Hey, who's Beetlejuice?
-Don't ever say that name!

798
00:43:22,303 --> 00:43:23,971
Not ever!

799
00:43:24,004 --> 00:43:26,207
-Beetlejuice.
-No! Astrid, I'm serious.

800
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,809
If you say that name
three times, really bad stuff

801
00:43:28,843 --> 00:43:30,177
-is gonna happen.
-Like what?

802
00:43:30,211 --> 00:43:32,179
In fact,
this attic is off-limits.

803
00:43:32,213 --> 00:43:33,848
Do you understand me?

804
00:43:33,881 --> 00:43:35,116
[Astrid] Yeah, I understand
that you're crazy.

805
00:43:38,986 --> 00:43:40,988
[laughing maniacally]

806
00:43:46,327 --> 00:43:50,898
[laborious breathing]

807
00:43:50,931 --> 00:43:52,233
Oh, my God, it's you!

808
00:43:52,266 --> 00:43:54,668
I thought a moose
was about to attack me.

809
00:43:54,702 --> 00:43:56,904
It's breathing exercises.

810
00:43:56,937 --> 00:43:58,639
Try seeing ghosts every day.

811
00:43:59,974 --> 00:44:01,008
Astrid!

812
00:44:02,109 --> 00:44:03,144
-Let her be.
-[sighs]

813
00:44:03,177 --> 00:44:04,879
God, she hates me.

814
00:44:04,912 --> 00:44:06,847
[Delia chuckles]

815
00:44:06,881 --> 00:44:09,416
[Lydia] Somehow, Richard's
death is still my fault.

816
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:11,352
You blamed me
for your mother's.

817
00:44:11,385 --> 00:44:13,087
She's not dead.

818
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,123
And I didn't blame you.
I resented you.

819
00:44:16,157 --> 00:44:17,258
There's a difference.

820
00:44:17,291 --> 00:44:18,859
You weren't very nice.

821
00:44:18,893 --> 00:44:21,362
No, you barely acknowledged
my existence.

822
00:44:21,395 --> 00:44:23,230
But we've done all right,
haven't we?

823
00:44:23,264 --> 00:44:26,300
Yeah. Ever since I sold out
and got famous,

824
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:27,735
we have gotten closer.

825
00:44:27,768 --> 00:44:29,336
No, I started liking you
before that.

826
00:44:31,138 --> 00:44:34,241
[breathing heavily]

827
00:44:34,275 --> 00:44:35,876
Again with
the creepy breathing!

828
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:37,711
It works!

829
00:44:37,745 --> 00:44:39,813
I learned it at the survivors'
retreat, where I met Rory.

830
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:41,182
[Delia] Of course you did.

831
00:44:41,215 --> 00:44:43,150
Look, I was in shock
after Richard died.

832
00:44:43,184 --> 00:44:45,219
And I was working on
my unresolved feelings,

833
00:44:45,252 --> 00:44:47,121
and Rory had just lost
his fiancee

834
00:44:47,154 --> 00:44:48,389
in a skiing accident,

835
00:44:48,422 --> 00:44:50,791
and we were
in the same sorrow circle

836
00:44:50,824 --> 00:44:52,359
and we connected.

837
00:44:52,393 --> 00:44:54,195
Yeah.

838
00:44:54,228 --> 00:44:56,397
He was turned on by you at
the lowest point in your life.

839
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:58,299
Okay, but this isn't about him.

840
00:44:58,332 --> 00:45:00,234
Astrid found this in the attic.

841
00:45:00,267 --> 00:45:02,036
Ew. So?

842
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:04,205
So?

843
00:45:04,238 --> 00:45:06,440
Every now and then
I feel his presence.

844
00:45:06,473 --> 00:45:08,008
Like he's lurking somewhere,

845
00:45:08,042 --> 00:45:09,476
just out of reach.

846
00:45:09,511 --> 00:45:10,911
But lately,

847
00:45:10,945 --> 00:45:12,446
I'm seeing him again.

848
00:45:12,479 --> 00:45:14,949
And I was really hoping
this was all in my head.

849
00:45:14,982 --> 00:45:16,317
But now this?

850
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:18,385
Lydia, you need
to take back your life.

851
00:45:18,419 --> 00:45:21,388
From the hanger-onners,
from this thing.

852
00:45:21,422 --> 00:45:23,023
Where's the obnoxious
little goth girl

853
00:45:23,057 --> 00:45:25,059
who tormented me
all those years ago?

854
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,494
It's time to find her.

855
00:45:42,009 --> 00:45:43,244
-[Astrid] Hey.
-Hey.

856
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:51,285
-[woman] Jeremy, is that you?
-Yeah.

857
00:45:51,318 --> 00:45:53,454
Uh, Mom, I'm just gonna
be upstairs with a friend.

858
00:45:53,487 --> 00:45:54,855
[woman] Okay. Have fun.

859
00:45:56,223 --> 00:45:58,325
[dishes clinking]

860
00:45:58,359 --> 00:45:59,561
[TV playing indistinctly]

861
00:45:59,594 --> 00:46:01,028
-[Jeremy] Hey, Dad.
-[man] Son.

862
00:46:01,061 --> 00:46:03,163
Stuck on...
He lives in that room.

863
00:46:10,004 --> 00:46:14,141
["Where's the Man" by Scott
Weiland playing on stereo]

864
00:46:14,174 --> 00:46:16,477
You've got a lot of '90s vinyl.

865
00:46:16,511 --> 00:46:17,579
Where are you
finding this, eBay?

866
00:46:17,612 --> 00:46:20,548
No, I troll old record stores.

867
00:46:20,582 --> 00:46:22,483
I don't trust
what I can't touch.

868
00:46:28,556 --> 00:46:30,057
Handbook for
the Recently Deceased.

869
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:32,326
Yeah, I got that
at a yard sale in town.

870
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:34,995
The illustrations
are pretty gnarly. [chuckles]

871
00:46:35,029 --> 00:46:36,598
[Astrid] Yeah, looks like
the kinda crappy book

872
00:46:36,631 --> 00:46:37,831
my mom would write.

873
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:40,434
What's the deal
with your parents?

874
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:43,070
Well, my mom spends
every waking hour

875
00:46:43,103 --> 00:46:45,839
in the kitchen stress-baking.

876
00:46:45,873 --> 00:46:48,175
And my dad used to work
at the paper mill,

877
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:49,877
but then he had an accident,

878
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:52,880
so now he's a full-time
couch potato.

879
00:46:52,913 --> 00:46:55,215
I can't wait to get out
of this shitty town.

880
00:46:57,151 --> 00:46:59,853
Um, you must have been
to a lot of places

881
00:46:59,887 --> 00:47:02,122
traveling, with a famous mom.

882
00:47:02,156 --> 00:47:04,058
[Astrid] Not really.

883
00:47:04,091 --> 00:47:05,926
My dad's
more the traveler anyway.

884
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:06,994
We used to have this big plan

885
00:47:07,027 --> 00:47:08,329
where we were gonna visit

886
00:47:08,362 --> 00:47:10,030
the top ten
creepiest places on Earth.

887
00:47:10,064 --> 00:47:13,267
So, Tower of London
and Dracula's Castle and...

888
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,337
[scoffs] yeah, then we never
got the chance to do it.

889
00:47:17,171 --> 00:47:18,238
What happened?

the Amazon for a week,

892
00:47:23,243 --> 00:47:24,478
and they never found his body.

she can't even see him.

-Why not?
-Because she's a fraud.

When I was a teenager,

964
00:50:10,444 --> 00:50:13,748

terrorized my entire family

965

and tried to force me
to marry him,

966
00:50:15,517 --> 00:50:18,686
in order to come back
to the real world for good.

967

I believed he was gone forever,

968
00:50:21,321 --> 00:50:23,558
and then lately,
I have been seeing him again.

And now, he is actually back.

Don't say his name!

973

three times,

he will appear.

otherwise, it's just
gonna get worse.

00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:18,659
and represented total chaos.

1066
00:54:18,693 --> 00:54:19,861
Okay, see,
that's why schools need

1067
00:54:19,894 --> 00:54:21,629
more art and less reading.

1068
00:54:21,662 --> 00:54:23,497
You got your wish,
we're leaving.

1069
00:54:23,531 --> 00:54:24,599
So go pack up your things,

1070
00:54:24,632 --> 00:54:25,767
I'm driving you back to school.

1071
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,300
Wait, what happened?

1072
00:54:27,334 --> 00:54:29,469
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

1073
00:54:29,504 --> 00:54:31,606
I will pay
for a fleet of movers

1074
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:33,641
to take everything
back to Manhattan,

1075
00:54:33,674 --> 00:54:34,909
except that model.

1076
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:37,310
We need to chop it up
and burn it.

1077
00:54:37,344 --> 00:54:38,679
[gasps] Oh.

1078
00:54:38,713 --> 00:54:40,748
You're calling off the wedding?

1079

1081
00:54:44,585 --> 00:54:45,887
What did that
cheese ball do now?

1082
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,354
It's not Rory.

1083
00:54:47,387 --> 00:54:48,421
It's [mouthing] Beetlejuice.

1084
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:49,557
[in normal voice] He's here.

1085
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:51,025
In the model. I saw him.

1086
00:54:51,058 --> 00:54:53,393
Rory saw him, too,
but he thinks it's a dream.

1087
00:54:53,426 --> 00:54:54,662
[Astrid] Wait,
we can't leave yet.

1088
00:54:56,429 --> 00:54:59,432
I have plans tomorrow
with this boy that I met.

1089
00:55:01,636 --> 00:55:03,638
How did you have time
to meet a boy?

1090
00:55:03,671 --> 00:55:05,072
You had time to get married.

1091
00:55:05,106 --> 00:55:07,775
[smacks lips] She doesn't
mean it. It's just karma.

1092
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:09,043
Whatever. I was biking

1093
00:55:09,076 --> 00:55:10,878
and then I kinda crashed
into his fence

1094
00:55:10,912 --> 00:55:12,713
and we started talking,

1095
00:55:12,747 --> 00:55:13,781
and then he invited me over
to his place for Halloween.

1096
00:55:16,017 --> 00:55:17,585
Can I go, Mom?

1097
00:55:17,618 --> 00:55:18,986
[Delia] Mmm-mmm.

1098
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,021
Please?

[Lydia mumbles]

1100
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:25,827
[Delia] I will not allow
that menace to humanity

1101
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,862
to upheave our family again.

1102
00:55:27,895 --> 00:55:31,132
No one goes in there,
no one calls his name!

1103
00:55:31,165 --> 00:55:33,034
We're gonna be fine, right?

1104
00:55:33,067 --> 00:55:35,636
[Astrid] Mom, come on!
I'm gonna be late.

Don't judge... all right?

His dad just got
into an accident at work,

1113
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:04,431

a rough patch.

Seriously?
This isn't a playdate.

1119
00:56:12,773 --> 00:56:13,808
I mean,
we're not six years old.

Nothing's gonna happen.

1121
00:56:14,909 --> 00:56:17,044
All right, okay. You're right.

1122
00:56:17,078 --> 00:56:20,147
Have fun,
and I'll pick you up at 10:00.

1123
00:56:20,181 --> 00:56:21,616
Not a second later.

Yeah. [chuckles]

I like the James Dean costume,
by the way.

Thank you. But yeah,

-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:57:18,139 --> 00:57:19,173
Yeah, her work was killing her.

1144
00:57:19,206 --> 00:57:20,608

It's probably
too much actually.

But, uh, we can, I don't know,

maybe binge on whatever's
left over, if you want?

Shit!

When my mom and dad
used to fight,

1170
00:58:49,263 --> 00:58:51,032
I used to steal
one of my dad's six-packs

1171
00:58:51,065 --> 00:58:53,067
and go hide out
in the tree fort.

But who's counting?

00:59:04,211 --> 00:59:05,713
I've been stuck in this house
for 23 years.

1179
00:59:05,746 --> 00:59:08,649
I can't go any further
than that tree.

But then you came along,

1182
00:59:13,354 --> 00:59:14,722
and you could see me.

1183
00:59:16,757 --> 00:59:18,259
And I've been on my own
for so long,

1184
00:59:18,292 --> 00:59:20,628

had gone off in my head.

Well, uh,

1194
00:59:39,713 --> 00:59:41,348
what if I told you

1195
00:59:41,382 --> 00:59:43,117
that I'd found a way
to come back.

Uh, everyone gets one of these

It's kind of complicated,

1200
00:59:51,659 --> 00:59:53,861
but, uh, I can only do it

1201
00:59:53,894 --> 00:59:57,698
with the help
of a living person.

1202
00:59:57,731 --> 01:00:00,734

give me my life back.

to help me.

The closest
we ever got to Disney

1232

was when Astrid dressed
as Cinderella's dead mom.

1233

You'll never guess
what the girls came up with.

-Fruit salad.

01:01:31,425 --> 01:01:33,394
"reverse mortgage."

1239
01:01:33,427 --> 01:01:35,329
Which is "mortgage"
spelled backwards.

1240
01:01:36,531 --> 01:01:38,132
Where is Astrid?

1241
01:01:38,165 --> 01:01:40,501
On a date. Her first.

1242
01:01:40,535 --> 01:01:43,070
I think I'm more nervous
than she is.

1243
01:01:43,103 --> 01:01:44,805
The boy lives over
on Jefferson.

1244
01:01:44,838 --> 01:01:46,941
Don't mention that street.

1245
01:01:46,974 --> 01:01:48,008
I have a listing that's kept me

1246
01:01:48,042 --> 01:01:50,144
from a perfect sales record.

1247
01:01:50,177 --> 01:01:52,046
Oh, it's my own fault.

1248
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:54,415
The place had been
on the market for years...

1249
01:01:54,448 --> 01:01:57,017
but I thought if I could sell
the "Murder House,"

1250
01:01:57,051 --> 01:01:58,419
it would be
a feather in my cap.

1251
01:01:58,452 --> 01:01:59,753
Murder House?

1252
01:02:00,287 --> 01:02:01,288
Which house?

1253
01:02:02,356 --> 01:02:04,225
125.

1254
01:02:04,258 --> 01:02:06,026
That's where
I dropped Astrid off.

1255
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:07,795
She was seeing
a boy named Jeremy.

1256
01:02:07,828 --> 01:02:10,864
-[unsettling music playing]
-Jeremy Frazier?

1257
01:02:10,898 --> 01:02:12,900
I didn't get his last name.

1258
01:02:13,968 --> 01:02:15,769
Oh, no, it can't be him.

1259
01:02:15,803 --> 01:02:18,906
But Jeremy Frazier
was bad news.

1260
01:02:18,939 --> 01:02:22,243
Twenty-three years ago,
he murdered his parents.

1261
01:02:22,276 --> 01:02:24,245
The cops found him
hiding in his tree house.

1262
01:02:24,278 --> 01:02:25,312
When they tried to get him out,

1263
01:02:25,346 --> 01:02:27,314
he fell, broke his neck,

1264
01:02:27,348 --> 01:02:29,083
died instantly.

1265
01:02:29,116 --> 01:02:30,117
[gasps]

1266
01:02:34,388 --> 01:02:37,024
That's all you have to do
to get into the Afterlife?

1267
01:02:37,057 --> 01:02:39,226
Draw a door with some chalk?

1268
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:40,528
Oh, and knock three times?

1269
01:02:40,562 --> 01:02:42,029
I'm just doing
what it says in there.

1270
01:02:42,062 --> 01:02:43,063
So lame.

1271
01:02:43,964 --> 01:02:46,033
[rumbling]

1272
01:02:46,066 --> 01:02:48,002
[debris clattering]

1273
01:02:48,035 --> 01:02:49,436
[suspenseful music playing]

1274
01:02:53,608 --> 01:02:55,843
-Or maybe it's not so lame.
-[chuckles]

1275
01:02:55,876 --> 01:02:57,579
And what do we do?
We just walk through?

1276
01:02:57,612 --> 01:02:59,514
I can. But since
you're still alive,

1277
01:02:59,547 --> 01:03:01,882
you have to read
that incantation first.

1278
01:03:04,151 --> 01:03:07,888
[reading in Latin] "De mundo
vivorum audeo in iterum..."

1279
01:03:07,921 --> 01:03:10,057
[children shouting]

1280
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:12,426
[tires screeching]

1281
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:14,895
[tense music playing]

1282
01:03:24,506 --> 01:03:25,507
[Lydia] Astrid!

1283
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:29,376
[grunts]

1284
01:03:31,211 --> 01:03:33,213
[woman] Jeremy, is that you?

1285
01:03:33,247 --> 01:03:35,583
[eerie music playing]

1286
01:03:35,617 --> 01:03:39,153
[tense music resumes]

1287
01:03:39,186 --> 01:03:42,056
"Ut liber iterum
ambulet alius."

1288
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:44,958
Okay.

1289
01:03:44,992 --> 01:03:46,427
I think that worked.

1290
01:03:47,194 --> 01:03:48,262
Astrid!

1291
01:03:51,633 --> 01:03:52,833
Let's go see your dad.

1292
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:58,072
[gasps] Astrid! No!

1293
01:04:04,411 --> 01:04:05,412
Okay.

1294
01:04:08,182 --> 01:04:14,188
[muzak playing]

1295
01:04:16,357 --> 01:04:18,526
Uh, okay, you just wait here.

1296
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,961
I'm gonna go find out
where we're supposed to go.

1297
01:04:20,994 --> 01:04:23,397
Make sure to ask
where my dad is.

1298
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:25,466
[Jeremy] Excuse me,
sorry, sorry for...

1299
01:04:27,201 --> 01:04:28,335
[Astrid] Merry Christmas.

1300
01:04:28,369 --> 01:04:29,571
[raspily] Merry Christmas.

1301
01:04:31,205 --> 01:04:32,473
[Jeremy] Thanks.

1302
01:04:32,507 --> 01:04:34,141
Okay, we need to go
to Immigration.

1303
01:04:41,281 --> 01:04:44,218
[Charles] Excuse me, can I
please speak to your manager?

1304
01:04:44,251 --> 01:04:47,287
My wife is gonna flay me
if I don't get home soon.

1305
01:04:47,321 --> 01:04:49,423
[woman] That's sweet.
Take a number and a seat.

1306
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:51,325
[Charles scoffs]

1307
01:04:54,228 --> 01:04:55,597
[sighs]

1308
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:57,197
Whoa, dude.

1309
01:04:57,231 --> 01:04:58,232
[blood spurting]

1310
01:04:59,133 --> 01:05:01,603
[haunting music playing]

1311
01:05:01,636 --> 01:05:04,171
[Delia] Oh,
Powers of the Hereafter,

1312
01:05:04,204 --> 01:05:08,275
accept my Charles as
I have accepted his passing.

1313
01:05:09,042 --> 01:05:10,512
No, I haven't.

1314
01:05:10,545 --> 01:05:12,547
And I won't ever.

1315
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:14,582
There is no expiry date
on sorrow.

1316
01:05:15,983 --> 01:05:18,252
Oh. Oh, that's good.

1317
01:05:18,285 --> 01:05:22,055
Though there is no expiry date
on sorrow!

1318
01:05:22,089 --> 01:05:23,625
Kings of Commerce,

1319
01:05:23,658 --> 01:05:25,192
Knights of Nasdaq,

1320
01:05:25,225 --> 01:05:29,463
deem him worthy to enter
the gates of your realm.

1321
01:05:29,496 --> 01:05:32,099
You are no more, my king.

1322
01:05:32,132 --> 01:05:34,268
But with the blessing
of the angels

1323
01:05:34,301 --> 01:05:36,003
-of undying love...
-[snakes hissing]

1324
01:05:36,738 --> 01:05:39,607
I, your surviving queen,

1325
01:05:39,641 --> 01:05:42,009
proudly take up the mantle
of your...

1326
01:05:42,042 --> 01:05:43,645

[snakes hissing]

1329
01:05:47,347 --> 01:05:49,349
[Rory] Okay.
There you go. Thank you.

1330
01:05:50,785 --> 01:05:52,620
You all right, honey?
You look a little manic.

1331
01:05:52,654 --> 01:05:54,188
Just pre-wedding jitters.

1332
01:05:54,221 --> 01:05:56,089
I'm just gonna go up
and try on my dress,

1333
01:05:56,123 --> 01:05:57,625
but don't come up

1334
01:05:57,659 --> 01:05:59,293
'cause it's bad luck to see me
before the ceremony.

1335
01:05:59,326 --> 01:06:00,327
Sure.

1336
01:06:01,228 --> 01:06:02,463
[children laughing]

1337
01:06:02,496 --> 01:06:05,132
Oh, well, hello.
Who's clowning around?

1338
01:06:05,165 --> 01:06:07,100
-[child 1] Trick or treat!
-[child 2] Trick or treat!

1339
01:06:07,134 --> 01:06:08,435
Here we are.

1340
01:06:08,469 --> 01:06:10,003
-Apples...
-[children] Thank you!

1341
01:06:10,037 --> 01:06:12,005
...carrot sticks,
and some blonde raisins,

1342
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:13,474
'cause no one likes
a big, fat clown.

1343
01:06:13,508 --> 01:06:15,442
[children laughing]

1344
01:06:15,476 --> 01:06:17,277
[tense music playing]

1345
01:06:17,311 --> 01:06:18,979
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1346
01:06:20,347 --> 01:06:22,517
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice,
Beetlejuice.

1347
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:23,585
[thunderclap]

1348
01:06:23,618 --> 01:06:26,086

[ground rumbling]

1352
01:06:42,604 --> 01:06:45,439
[sinister music playing]

1353
01:06:52,212 --> 01:06:54,214
The Juice is loose.

1354
01:06:55,249 --> 01:06:56,483
[gasps]

1355
01:06:56,518 --> 01:06:57,752
I need you to tell me
what this means.

1356
01:06:57,785 --> 01:07:00,688
Oh, well, let's have a look,
shall we?

1357
01:07:00,722 --> 01:07:03,223
Long story short,
your daughter's screwed.

1358
01:07:03,257 --> 01:07:05,292
She decided to trade lives
with the boy.

1359
01:07:05,325 --> 01:07:06,728
He gets to come back,

1360
01:07:06,761 --> 01:07:08,428
while she's stuck
on the other side permanently.

1361
01:07:08,462 --> 01:07:10,330
One-way ticket
on the Soul Train.

1362
01:07:10,364 --> 01:07:11,599
-Soul Train?
-That's right.

1363
01:07:11,633 --> 01:07:14,201
Last stop, the Great Beyond.

1364
01:07:14,234 --> 01:07:15,737
No, she can't
get on that train.

1365
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:17,539
You've gotta get me in there
so I can get her out.

1366
01:07:17,572 --> 01:07:19,139
Well, I can get you in,

1367
01:07:19,172 --> 01:07:21,308
but it's gonna
take a quid pro quo.

1368
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:23,477
Of course there is.
What do you want?

1369
01:07:23,511 --> 01:07:25,345
Well, I've got this ex-wife,
you know?

1370
01:07:25,379 --> 01:07:27,582
And she's kind of a whack job,
first of all. We're through.

1371
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,316
She's kinda clingy.

1372
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:30,417
If I could just get away
from her permanently somehow.

1373
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:31,819
You want me to marry you!

1374
01:07:31,853 --> 01:07:33,487
I thought you'd never ask.

1375
01:07:33,521 --> 01:07:35,322
How do I know that
you're gonna keep your word?

1376
01:07:35,355 --> 01:07:37,190
I swear
on my dead mother's soul.

1377
01:07:37,224 --> 01:07:38,458
Yikes!

1378
01:07:40,562 --> 01:07:42,162
Okay, fine.

1379
01:07:42,195 --> 01:07:44,197
I'll marry you if you help me
save my daughter.

1380
01:07:44,231 --> 01:07:45,432
I'm gonna need that in writing.

1381
01:07:45,465 --> 01:07:47,134
-Give me that.
-Ow.

1382
01:07:47,167 --> 01:07:48,168
And here we go.

1383
01:07:51,204 --> 01:07:52,574
I'm gonna make you so happy.

1384
01:07:52,607 --> 01:07:55,309
Jesus! What's the plan
on getting in?

1385
01:07:55,342 --> 01:07:56,410
[chalk scraping]

1386
01:08:01,616 --> 01:08:02,717
Yeah.

1387
01:08:04,819 --> 01:08:07,354
Well, can't exactly
go through the front door.

[caller 3] Tell Beetlejuice

1393
01:08:25,873 --> 01:08:27,575
these people
are still in my house.

[shrinkers gasping]

1395
01:08:31,411 --> 01:08:33,548
[caller 3] Hello? Hello?

1396
01:08:35,215 --> 01:08:36,216
You never saw us.

1397
01:08:36,851 --> 01:08:37,852
¿Comprende?

1398
01:08:39,453 --> 01:08:41,923
Bob, you and the boys
stand guard.

1399
01:08:41,956 --> 01:08:43,725
Nobody gets through.
[snaps fingers]

1400
01:08:45,727 --> 01:08:46,728
Let's go, honey.

1405

One each.

Honor system.

1407
01:09:12,654 --> 01:09:14,388
Yeah, right. Asshole.

Well, be not afraid,

with fear and trembling?

Yes! I'm shitting my pants.

-Ah.
-What are you doing here?

for the lost lambs

1600

Um, sorry, I'm just, uh,

Hi, yes, one question,
how do I get out of here?

1609
01:19:17,024 --> 01:19:18,425
Because someone
made a terrible mistake.

1610

Take a number. Take a seat.

I paid extra for that.

Honey, you're dead, okay?

1614
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,935
Now take a number and sit down.

1615
01:19:31,338 --> 01:19:35,876

who has the power to help me?

My husband's here.
Charles Deetz.

1621

Yes, he can fix this.

You call him, he can fix this,

Not anymore he can't.

[Damien] We're about to start.

Wait, Mom, with everything
that's happened tonight,

1673
01:22:50,772 --> 01:22:52,239
you know you don't
have to do this, right?

I know,
but if I don't do it now,

This is just
a couple influencers.

a Netflix executive in there.

All that matters
is that I'm here, now.

So let's just skip
straight to the vows.

is you can never,
ever say my name, ever!
