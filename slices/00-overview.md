# Development Slices Overview

## Purpose
This directory contains incremental development slices for building the Private Event Streaming Platform. Each slice represents a self-contained, deliverable increment that builds upon previous slices.

## Slice Organization

### Phase 1: Foundation (Slices 1-2)
- **Slice 01**: Project Foundation & Setup
- **Slice 02**: Authentication System

### Phase 2: Core Video Features (Slices 3-4)
- **Slice 03**: Video Playback
- **Slice 04**: Stream Management

### Phase 3: Engagement Features (Slices 5-6)
- **Slice 05**: Real-Time Chat System
- **Slice 06**: Polling System

### Phase 4: Administration (Slice 7)
- **Slice 07**: Admin Panel & Controls

### Phase 5: Production Readiness (Slices 8-10)
- **Slice 08**: Security Hardening
- **Slice 09**: Performance Optimization
- **Slice 10**: Testing & Deployment

## How to Use These Slices

1. **Sequential Development**: Build slices in order (1→10), as each depends on previous slices
2. **Acceptance Criteria**: Each slice includes clear acceptance criteria for completion
3. **Dependencies**: Dependencies are explicitly listed in each slice
4. **Flexibility**: Within a slice, tasks can be reordered based on team preferences

## Estimated Timeline

| Slice | Focus Area | Estimated Time | Cumulative |
|-------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| 01 | Foundation | 4-6 hours | 4-6h |
| 02 | Authentication | 3-4 hours | 7-10h |
| 03 | Video Playback | 4-6 hours | 11-16h |
| 04 | Stream Management | 3-4 hours | 14-20h |
| 05 | Chat System | 6-8 hours | 20-28h |
| 06 | Polling System | 6-8 hours | 26-36h |
| 07 | Admin Panel | 4-6 hours | 30-42h |
| 08 | Security | 3-4 hours | 33-46h |
| 09 | Performance | 2-3 hours | 35-49h |
| 10 | Testing & Deploy | 4-6 hours | 39-55h |

**Total Estimated Time**: 39-55 hours (5-7 working days)

## Success Metrics

Each slice should be:
- ✅ **Deployable**: Can be pushed to staging and tested
- ✅ **Testable**: Has clear acceptance criteria
- ✅ **Documented**: Includes implementation notes
- ✅ **Reviewable**: Changes are atomic and reviewable

## Notes

- Slices are designed for ~30 concurrent viewers (initial scale)
- Focus on rapid deployment over premature optimization
- Security and performance are built-in, not bolted-on
- Each slice should take 2-8 hours to complete

## Getting Started

Begin with `01-foundation.md` and proceed sequentially through each slice.
