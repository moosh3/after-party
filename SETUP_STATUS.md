## ⚠️ Needs Attention

### 1. Supabase Realtime (IMPORTANT)
**Status**: Not yet enabled  
**Impact**: Messages save but don't appear in real-time  
**How to fix** (Choose one method):

**Method 1 - Dashboard (Easiest)**:
1. Go to https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to: **Database → Replication**
4. Find the `supabase_realtime` publication
5. Add these tables: `messages`, `current_stream`, `polls`, `poll_votes`

**Method 2 - SQL**:
```bash
npm run enable:realtime
```
Or paste contents of `sql/enable_realtime.sql` into Supabase SQL Editor

**Why Postgres Changes?**
This app uses the [Postgres Changes](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/subscribing-to-database-changes#using-postgres-changes) approach because it works with anonymous users. The [Broadcast method](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/subscribing-to-database-changes#using-broadcast) requires Supabase authenticated users.

**Verification**: After enabling, send a chat message and it should appear immediately without refresh.

### 2. Mux Configuration (Optional)
**Status**: Using placeholder tokens  
**Impact**: Can only play public demo videos  
**Current**: Big Buck Bunny (public demo) works fine  
**To enable private videos**:
1. Create account at https://mux.com
2. Get API credentials
3. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   MUX_TOKEN_ID=your-token-id
   MUX_TOKEN_SECRET=your-token-secret
   MUX_SIGNING_KEY_ID=your-signing-key-id
   MUX_SIGNING_KEY_PRIVATE=your-private-key
   ```

## 📸 Current State

The application is **functional** and displays:
- ✅ Video player with Big Buck Bunny streaming
- ✅ Custom video controls (play/pause, volume, fullscreen)
- ✅ Chat interface accepting messages
- ✅ Clean, modern UI with dark theme
- ⚠️ Chat messages not appearing in real-time (pending Realtime setup)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Enable Realtime in Supabase** (5 minutes)
   - This will make chat messages appear instantly
   - Essential for production use

2. **Test Realtime** (2 minutes)
   - Send a chat message
   - Verify it appears immediately
   - Open two browser windows to test cross-client updates

3. **Optional: Configure Mux**
   - Only needed if you want to upload and stream your own videos
   - Current demo video works without Mux credentials

4. **Optional: Set up admin panel**
   - Go to `/admin/login`  
   - Use password from `.env.local` (ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH)
   - Default test password: "admin123"

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

1. ❌ "supabaseKey is required" error
   - **Cause**: Server-only client being imported in browser components
   - **Fix**: Created separate `lib/supabase-admin.ts` file
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED

2. ❌ Video player 400 error with token
   - **Cause**: Placeholder token being sent for public video
   - **Fix**: Don't include token parameter for placeholder tokens
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED

3. ❌ API returning 404 for `/api/current`
   - **Cause**: No stream data in database
   - **Fix**: Seeded demo data
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED

## 📚 Useful Commands

```bash
# Check database status
npm run setup:db

# Seed demo data
npm run seed:demo

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Generate new admin password hash
npm run generate-admin-hash
```
